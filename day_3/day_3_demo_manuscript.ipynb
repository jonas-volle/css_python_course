    "### Was ist ein API?\n",
    "\n",
    "- **I**nterface (Benutzeroberfläche): Interaktion zwischen Mensch und Computer, um bestimmte Aufgaben zu erledigen, ohne dass er verstehen muss, wie diese Aufgabe tatsächlich ausgeführt wird.  \n",
    "- Wie Benutzeroberflächen machen APIs schwierige Dinge einfacher, indem sie eine Menge von Prozessen auf niedriger Ebene abstrahieren. APIs bündeln Funktionen damit diese besonders leicht zu verstehen und zu verwenden sind.\n",
    "\n",
    "### RESTful APIs\n",
    "- Besondere Art von APIs, die auf dem REST (Representational State Transfer) Prinzip basieren.\n",
    "- RESTful APIs ermöglichen die Kommunikation und den Datenaustausch zwischen verschiedenen Anwendungen über das Internet.\n",
    "- RESTful APIs arbeiten nach dem Client-Server-Modell, wobei der Client Anfragen (Requests) an den Server sendet und der Server entsprechend antwortet.\n",
    "- Die Daten werden normalerweise im JSON- oder XML-Format übertragen.\n",
    "- RESTful APIs sind zustandslos, was bedeutet, dass jede Anfrage unabhängig ist und der Server keine Informationen über vergangene Anfragen speichert.\n",
    "- Zugriff über Endpunkte (Endpoints)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Requests mit Python\n",
    "- Requests werden an einen bestimmten Endpunkt (Endpoint) gesendet in Form einer URL (APIs können verschiedene Enpoints haben!)\n",
    "- Diese URL besteht aus verschiedenen Teilen, die wir so spezifizieren können (Suchbegriffe, Filter, Parameter etc.), sodass wir den gewünschten Inhalt zurück bekommen.\n",
    "- Die meisten APIs haben *rate limits*, also Obergrenzen für Anfragen in einer bestimmten Zeitspanne. \n",
    "\n",
    "### API keys oder tokens\n",
    "- Um Anfragen an einen API zu senden, benötigen wir in den meisten Fällen einen API key oder API token.\n",
    "- API keys oder tokens funktionieren wie Benutzername und Passwort die uns identifizieren.\n",
    "- Diese keys können auf der jeweiligen Webseite des APIs beantragt werden und werden uns dann zugewiesen.\n",
    "- Es ist wichtig, dass wir diese Zugangsdaten nicht teilen, das heißt auch nicht direkt in unser Script schreiben.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Responses\n",
    "- Wenn wir eine GET-Anfrage an den API senden, bekommen wir im Gegenzug eine Antwort (response)\n",
    "- In den meisten Fällen bekommen wir die Daten im `json`-Format zurück. Das steht für *JavaScript Object Notation*.\n",
    "- `json` ist eine genestete Datenstruktur, die aussieht wie ein *dictionary* in Python und in der die Daten in *key-value* Paaren gespeichert sind.\n",
    "- Mit dem Python Paket `json` können wir diese Datenstrukturen wie ein `dictionary` behandeln.\n",
    "- Mit `pandas` Methode `.read_json()` können wir dieses Datenformat auch direkt in einen Dataframe umwandeln."

    "2. Der tags-Endpunkt liefert API-Tags für mehr als 50.000 Ergebnisse, die in anderen API-Abfragen verwendet werden können. \n",
    "3. Der sections-ENdpunkt liefert Informationen über die Gruppierung veröffentlichter Artikel in Sektionen. \n",
    "4. Der editions-Endpunkt liefert Inhalte für jede der regionalen Hauptseiten: USA UK, Australien und International. \n",

As the outbreak <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/ng-interactive/2020/apr/08/coronavirus-100-days-that-changed-the-world\">passed the 100-day mark</a> and many countries extended their lockdowns, others moved to relax restrictions wary that cases may take off again.</p> \\n<h2><strong>Scientists shed light on </strong><strong>immune response to coronavirus</strong></h2> \\n<p>On Monday, a team at Fudan University in Shanghai <a href=\"https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.30.20047365v1\">reported the first detailed analysis</a> of the immune response in patients with coronavirus. Tests on the blood of 175 patients who had been discharged from hospitals in Shanghai revealed that neutralising antibodies – those that can wipe out the virus – usually arose 10 to 15 days after the onset of illness and targeted three different parts of the “spike” protein on the virus’s surface.</p> \\n<p>While older patients produced the highest levels of neutralising antibodies, many patients had low levels and 10 did not appear to generate them at all. If the findings hold up – the study has yet to be reviewed and published – they have widespread implications. The more robust immune response from older people suggests their blood plasma may work best in trials that are assessing whether <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2020/mar/29/coronavirus-survivors-blood-plasma-could-be-used-to-fight-infection\">convalescent plasma</a> infusions can help seriously ill patients overcome the virus. But the findings may frustrate <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2020/apr/08/health-minister-defends-uk-coronavirus-testing-approach-chris-whitty-germany-covid-19\">efforts to manufacture an accurate antibody test</a> for the virus if many people have low or even non-existent levels of neutralising antibodies. This week it emerged that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/09/uk-government-urged-to-abandon-poor-finger-prick-antibody-tests-coronavirus\">none of the antibody tests</a> purchased by the UK government were good enough to roll out.</p> \\n<p>The work also has implications for<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/30/immunity-passports-could-speed-up-return-to-work-after-covid-19\"> “immunity passports”</a>, which could allow people to return to normal life if blood tests showed they had developed immunity to the virus. Nearly 6% of the recovered patients had no neutralising antibodies, suggesting that other parts of the immune system had cleared the infection, without producing long-term immunity.</p> \\n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"ba9786c6-c779-4063-8bf9-1d3009eb7c70\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \\n  <div>\\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/3qV7R2iYVXg?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\\n  </div>\\n </gu-atom> \\n</figure> \\n<h2><strong>Not everyone agrees on wearing face masks</strong></h2> \\n<p>Whether or not to don a face mask in public became a matter of debate and confusion. After a <a href=\"https://www.who.int/publications-detail/advice-on-the-use-of-masks-in-the-community-during-home-care-and-in-healthcare-settings-in-the-context-of-the-novel-coronavirus-(2019-ncov)-outbreak\">review of new evidence</a>, the World Health Organization maintained its view on Monday that while people who have cough, fever and difficulty breathing should wear a mask and seek medical help, there was no need for healthy people to wear face masks in public. The organisation conceded that people without symptoms can spread the virus, but only recommended healthy people wear face masks when they were caring for a coronavirus patient and in the same room. The masks can help prevent infections by catching large virus-laden droplets that are expelled from patients when they cough and sneeze, but <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/apr/03/face-masks-coronavirus-scientists-evidence-covid-19-public\">David Heymann</a>, who chairs the WHO’s risk committee, said face masks can give people a false sense of security if they do not combine an effective one with eye protection and adopt strict hand hygiene measures.</p> \\n<p>The UK has a similar stance to the WHO and does not recommend healthy people wear masks in public. But the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) not only <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/prevent-getting-sick/cloth-face-cover.html\">advises people to wear face masks</a> outside, but offers guidance on how to make “cloth face coverings” too. On Tuesday, US government scientists argued the case for face coverings after <a href=\"https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.02.20051177v1\">preliminary research</a> showed people spray out thousands of tiny saliva droplets when they speak simple sentences such as “stay healthy”. Adriaan Bax at the US National Institutes of Health, who led the work, found a damp homemade cloth face mask “dramatically reduced droplet excretion”.</p> \\n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"a81dbd86-f7c7-4b2d-affa-9a6aff9b9b5f\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \\n  <div>\\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/4xFY3aPF7E4?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\\n  </div>\\n </gu-atom> \\n</figure> \\n<h2><strong>Some countries look towards easing </strong><strong>lockdowns</strong></h2> \\n<p>Following in the footsteps of China, a number of countries announced plans to relax restrictions they had put in place to stop the spread of the virus. On Wednesday, China, lifted its 11-week lockdown in Wuhan where the outbreak began. The following day, the Czech Republic allowed bicycle shops and DIY, hobby and hardware stores to reopen. After the Easter break, Austria will let small shops, DIY stores and garden centres return to business, while Denmark plans to reopen kindergartens and primary schools. But with the virus still present and large numbers of people still vulnerable to infection, health officials are watching closely for cases to surge again. As Denmark’s prime minister, Metter Frederiksen, commented: “It’s like walking a tightrope.”</p> \\n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \\n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/gallery/2020/apr/08/wuhan-ends-coronavirus-lockdown-in-pictures\">Wuhan ends coronavirus lockdown – in pictures</a> </p> \\n</aside> \\n<p>The British prime minister, Boris Johnson, was admitted to intensive care for several days but <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global/2020/apr/09/boris-johnson-moved-from-intensive-care-but-stays-in-hospital\">returned to a ward on Thursday</a> after he improved without needing mechanical ventilation. In his absence, the foreign secretary, Dominic Raab, scotched hopes for an early end to the UK lockdown and refused to be drawn on exit strategies until the country was beyond the peak of the epidemic. But discussions are underway in Whitehall where options range from a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2020/apr/09/lifting-lockdown-uk-options-graded-return-normality\">“youth first”</a> policy that would allow young workers to return to their jobs, to a staggered <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/apr/09/uk-lockdown-could-end-with-sector-by-sector-plan-for-firms\">sector-by-sector approach</a>.

President Trump imposed restrictions on travellers from China at the end of January but only blocked travel from most European countries in mid-March. Separate teams at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai in New York City and New York University reached similar conclusions after studying the genetic code of viruses obtained from patients in the region. The scientists traced the origins of the outbreak by analysing patterns of mutations that accumulate in viruses as they spread. “The majority is clearly European,” Harm van Bakel, a geneticist from one of the teams, told the <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/08/science/new-york-coronavirus-cases-europe-genomes.html\">New York Times</a>. The same approach was used last month to trace the coronavirus back to <a href=\"https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.30.015008v1\">infected bats</a>.</p> \\n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \\n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/ng-interactive/2020/apr/09/how-coronavirus-spread-across-the-globe-visualised\">How coronavirus spread across the globe - visualised</a> </p> \\n</aside> \\n<h2><strong>And finally…</strong></h2> \\n<p>As streets emptied out and factories closed their doors, scientists at the British Geological Survey noticed their sensitive earthquake-detecting seismometers had stopped twitching as much. Closer inspection of the charts revealed that the lockdown has changed how the Earth moves beneath our feet: there are fewer vibrations from human noise passing through the planet.</p> \\n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \\n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/09/climate-crisis-amid-coronavirus-lockdown-nature-bounces-back-but-for-how-long\">Climate crisis: in coronavirus lockdown, nature bounces back – but for how long?</a> </p> \\n</aside> \\n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2020/apr/06/lockdown-has-cut-britains-vibrations-seismologists-find\">fall in background noise</a>, particularly around urban seismometers, has left scientists wondering if they might detect earthquakes that are smaller than normal, or at distances that are normally beyond their range. With lockdowns easing around the world, they do not have long to look. As Brian Baptie at the BGS conceded: “We may not get anything in the short term.”</p>',\n",

       "   'body': '<p>As the daughter of an air force officer and a nurse, I am fascinated by defence systems. There is none more impressive than the human immune system, equipped as it is with a rich arsenal to defend against different types of pathogen. Viruses have evolved to trick, bypass and evade these defences. Our immune systems have, in turn, learned to recognise and deter these virus stealth tactics. In Covid-19, the enemy is a tiny piece of genetic material wearing a lipid coat and a protein crown.</p> <p>So how is our immune system able to defend against viral infections, and how does this apply to Covid-19? The virus that causes Covid-19 is called severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (Sars-Cov-2), and was first detected in humans around five months ago. It is a coronavirus. “Corona”, in Latin, means crown. The virus is adorned with an outer layer of protein covered in spikes, like a crown. These spikes help the virus attach itself to target cells. The research community is<strong> </strong>fast learning about immunity to Covid-19, and we are also applying our knowledge of similar respiratory viruses to predict what to expect in this infection.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Importantly, Covid-19 cannot gain entry to our homes or bodies by itself – we have to let it in</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Think of a virus as a robot; it cannot reproduce so it needs a factory of materials – proteins, lipids and nucleotides –<strong> </strong>to build copies of itself. The coat allows the virus to attach itself to the target cell’s membrane. The virus then fuses with the cell and releases a<strong> </strong>shopping list of instructions<strong> </strong>on how to build and assemble new viruses. This shopping list, the virus genome, is written in nucleotides (RNA). The first job of a virus that enters our bodies is to invade target cells so that it can comfortably remove its coat and deploy its RNA.</p> <p>Once inside, the virus commandeers the cell and borrows cellular machinery<strong> </strong>to build more viruses before immune cells detect the intruders and raise the alarm. Antibody proteins that are able to stick to the virus-spike proteins, and prevent attachment to the target cells, are called neutralising antibodies: generating them is often the goal of protective vaccination.</p> <p>Our infected cells make the ultimate sacrifice and invite their own destruction by displaying distress signals for<strong> </strong>T-cells, which swiftly detect and kill them. T-cells are cytotoxic – powerful serial killers that can recognise peptide fragments of virus displayed on the infected cell surface. When they do, they release a payload of toxic enzymes that kill the infected cell in a “kiss of death”. This strategic martyrdom is organised by the immune system to deprive the virus of its replication factories and can lead to the reduction of viral load in the patient. It takes several days for antiviral T-cells to expand and antibodies to be generated. Here’s the silver lining<strong>:</strong> memory cells ensure that if we encounter the same virus again, we can react immediately with pre-existing defences. Sars-Cov-2 is new to humanity so we have no protective immunological memory. Vaccines prepared using harmless parts of the virus can help us build protective memory.</p> <p>The virus’s enemy superpower is spreading. The virus achieves this through “shedding” from infected patients. Sars-Cov-2 is expert at hopping from person to person, and in some people, it achieves a stealthy existence with mild or no symptoms. Once many copies of the virus are made, it needs to jump to another host. It hitches a ride on droplets that can be coughed or sneezed to a distance of up to two metres. Droplets can survive on surfaces for several hours enabling pick<strong>-</strong>up by a new host, or they can be directly inhaled if another person is in close proximity. Studies are emerging into <a href=\"https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2020/03/should-pets-be-tested-coronavirus\">animal hosts</a> – so far the virus has been detected in a few ferrets, cats, tigers and dogs. No animal deaths have yet been reported, and we don’t know if animals can transmit back to humans.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/21/coronavirus-vaccine-scientist-what-needs-to-be-done-now-hanneke-schuitemaker\">Vaccine scientist: ‘Everything is so new in dealing with this coronavirus’</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The age differential in fatalities for Covid-19 suggests, with some exceptions, that a healthy immune system is usually able to control infection. Meanwhile, an ageing or weakened immune system may struggle to deploy a protective arsenal. Importantly, Sars-Cov-2 cannot gain entry to our homes or bodies by itself – we have to let it in. This is why official advice has centred around<strong> </strong>cleaning our hands and avoiding touching our faces.</p> <p>We know that a healthy immune system is usually able to eliminate infection in a couple of weeks. However, we have no understanding of the components of our immune arsenal that contribute to this feat: some vaccines work by creating potent neutralising antibodies; other vaccines generate powerful memory T-cells. Antiviral antibodies emerge as early as three to four days after virus detection, but are they protective against future reinfection? We believe that antibodies to other coronaviruses (Sars, Mers) last from one to three years. Because this is a new virus, we don’t yet know the answer to this question. Public Health England is <a href=\"https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/878121/coronavirus-covid-19-testing-strategy.pdf\">recruiting</a> 16,000 to 20,000 volunteers to monitor antibodies once a month for six to 12 months to confirm whether we can generate long-lasting antibody responses to Sars-Cov-2. Determining the quality of these antibodies will be important to understanding long-term protection.</p> <p>What is our most potent immune weapon against Covid-19? <a href=\"https://twitter.com/bertoletti_lab/status/1247015473683632129\">Cytotoxic T-cells</a> may play an important role. Immunologists and virologists are working together to discover the correlates of protection, to design vaccines that offer long-term defences against Covid-19. Years of investment in research means that we can use existing approaches to respond to this new threat, and early mobilisation of research funders, philanthropists and academics are diverting resources to bolster these efforts on an unprecedented scale. Experience has taught us that vaccines are able to eradicate infections from this planet (for instance, smallpox), and medicines against viruses that don’t embed their genetic material to our own (for example, hepatitis C) can also achieve this.</p> <p>Our secret weapon is research. Scientists are working hard on understanding Covid-19, and collaboration is key to this effort. But until a vaccine or treatment is available, we ought to work hard to protect ourselves and our families: isolate and prevent transmission by using physical distancing, face masks and sensible hygiene. If we all do our part, this little virus holding the world to ransom won’t stand a chance.</p> <p>• Zania Stamataki is a senior lecturer and researcher in viral immunology at the University of Birmingham</p>',\n",

Like all the best epigrams, it is deeply wise, even if it overgeneralises. I can’t think of many instances from my own life where it isn’t true. A breakdown, a miscarriage, a job lost – they all led to better things.</p> <p>The phrase reminds me of something Winston Churchill supposedly said on losing the 1945 election. His wife apparently told him that defeat may well have been a blessing in disguise. “Madame, if this is a blessing, it is indeed well disguised,” he replied.</p> <p>And yet a blessing it was. Britain got Attlee, the welfare state, the NHS. Churchill got a rest, and then his swansong six years later. The rest is history.</p> <p>And so to the present.

       "   'body': '<p>Call centre staff at the NHS’s 111 helpline are turning up to work with coronavirus symptoms owing to a lack of adequate sick pay, according to a whistleblower who has filed a complaint to MPs.</p> <p>Concerns about health and safety have been raised by call handlers at at least three call centres where thousands of people are employed by outsourcing firms to field calls to the 111 service.</p> <p>One employee, whose complaint has been published by a commons select committee, told the Guardian that colleagues felt ill-prepared for the mass volume of calls and “terrified” they would catch the virus due to “unsafe” working conditions.</p> <p>The call-handler, who works for the outsourcing firm Teleperformance, said communal equipment including coffee machines, exit buttons and door handles were cleaned only twice a day – which the company does not dispute – and that staff were given only “very, very basic” training on how to handle 111 calls about the coronavirus.</p> <p>The government has asked some of the UK’s biggest private call centre operators to massively scale up their NHS 111 capacity amid a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2020/apr/05/calls-nhs-111-soar-400-since-start-coronavirus-crisis-uk\">400% increase in calls</a> due to the outbreak. Scores of often inexperienced staff have been hired in huge numbers in only a few days, posing challenges for the employees and companies involved.</p> <p>The call handler, who asked not to be named for fear of losing his job, said: “Managers, floorwalkers and staff have all been thrown into this with very, very basic training and there are a lot of situations that we aren’t prepared for.”</p> <p>The agency worker said staff with potential Covid-19 symptoms, such as a persistent cough, were coming into work as they could not afford to live on the statutory sick pay (SSP) of £96 a week: “There are lots of people coughing around the call centre who haven’t been self-isolating because there is no guarantee of our jobs being there when we come back… Most of us can’t survive on SSP.”</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Callout callout-coronavirus-key-workers\">  <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div data-callout-tagname=&quot;callout-coronavirus-key-workers&quot;&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Callout&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;callout-coronavirus-key-workers&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>Concerns have also been raised by staff at the Teleperformance’s offices in Manchester and <a href=\"https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/politics/fearful-scots-call-centre-staff-21769687\">in Scotland</a>. The French company, which is one of the government’s biggest call centre operators, said more than half of its nearly 7,000 call handlers were working from home and that the health, safety and security of its staff “has always been our top priority”. It said it had ordered hundreds of thousands of masks for employees and that cleaning of communal areas had increased from once a week to twice daily.</p> <p>Gary Slade, the company’s UK chief executive, said it was “fully compliant” with the government’s sick pay guidelines and that anyone who displayed Covid-19 symptoms was being sent home to self-isolate. “This is not about making money [or] treating people badly – we’ve never been that way,” he added. “But this is definitely without doubt our number one priority: do what’s right for our people and that’s what we’re doing.</p> <p>“Are we perfect? Probably not. There’s always room for improvement. But we’re doing everything we can, working as hard and as fast as we can.”</p> <p>The Guardian found several outsourcing firms recruiting NHS 111 operators for as little as <a href=\"https://www.reed.co.uk/jobs/111-call-handler/40211636?source=details.similarjobs\">£9.09 an hour</a> – barely above the UK minimum wage – despite their role as the first point of contact for people who think they have the coronavirus. One outsourcing firm <a href=\"https://www.reed.co.uk/jobs/home/view/40183565\">said</a> in its job advertisement that no previous customer service experience was needed, adding: “Your personality is far more important than your previous experience.”</p> <p>Concerns have been raised by NHS 111 operators at another firm, Sitel. The Labour MP Luke Pollard said he had received complaints from “dozens” of staff employed at the firm’s call centre in Plymouth, which is handling 111 calls. Staff told him they were working “desk to desk”, in breach of the coronavirus physical distancing rules, and that workplaces were not being deep-cleaned, leaving many afraid to go to work for fear of catching the virus.</p> <p>The company, which is owned by one of the world’s richest families, is said to have instructed call handlers not to speak to the media about their concerns. Pollard said: “If you’re scared of going to work, that is as real as it can get and that needs to be addressed.”</p> <p>Sitel declined to answer a series of questions when contacted by the Guardian. A spokeswoman confirmed that the company was in dialogue with Pollard and that it was following the safety measures outlined on <a href=\"https://www.sitel.com/covid-19-updates/\">its website</a>.</p>',\n",

       "   'body': '<p>If, like me, you have been confined to your home, glued to the news and nursing ever greater anxiety about the state of the world, you have probably become familiar with the sight of the World Health Organization’s director general, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, and his daily press briefings. Tedros, as he is known, is a calming presence in the midst of the crisis. Flanked by an international cast of scientists, he always seems confident that if we have hope, listen to the experts and pull together, we will get through this.</p> <p>Watching this reassuring spectacle, it is possible to imagine a world in which every nation respects the WHO’s authority, follows its advice and lets it coordinate the flow of information, resources and medical equipment across national boundaries to areas of greatest need.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/audio/2020/may/01/the-who-v-coronavirus-why-it-cant-handle-the-pandemic-podcast\">The WHO v coronavirus: why it can\\'t handle the pandemic – podcast</a> </p> </aside>  <p>That is not the world we live in. “The W.H.O. really blew it. For some reason, funded largely by the United States, yet very China centric,” <a href=\"https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1247540701291638787\" title=\"\">tweeted</a> Donald Trump on 7 April, summing up just one of the many lines of criticism the WHO is currently facing. It is not just Trump – even some of the WHO’s supporters in government, academia and NGOs argue that since the start of the coronavirus crisis, it has caved in to nationalist bullies, praised draconian quarantine measures and failed to protect the liberal international order of which it is a linchpin. “You’ve got a situation where it looks like WHO doesn’t want to exercise its authority,” said David Fidler, a fellow in global health at the Council on Foreign Relations and a regular consultant to the WHO.</p> <p>Meanwhile, the WHO is desperately struggling to get its 194 member states to actually follow its guidance. The WHO’s leaders are “very frustrated,” said John MacKenzie, a virologist and adviser on the WHO’s <a href=\"https://www.who.int/ihr/procedures/novel-coronavirus-2019/ec-22012020-members/en/\" title=\"\">emergency committee</a>. “The messages come out loud and clear, and some disregard the warnings. The US largely did, the UK largely did.”</p> <p>On 11 March, the day Tedros declared the coronavirus a pandemic, he spoke darkly of “alarming levels of inaction” from many countries. Pressed by journalists to name them, Mike Ryan, the usually no-nonsense Irish trauma doctor who heads the WHO’s Covid-19 response, demurred. “You know who you are,” he said, adding that “we don’t criticise our member states in public”.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"f5d9b5d69d079af3d45a26a68aba8a4108aca8e6\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f5d9b5d69d079af3d45a26a68aba8a4108aca8e6/0_100_4554_2732/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Donald Trump at a coronavirus task force briefing at the White House on April 08, 2020 in Washington, DC.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Donald Trump at a coronavirus task force briefing at the White House.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>There is a simple reason for this. For all the responsibility vested in the WHO, it has little power. Unlike international bodies such as the World Trade Organization, the WHO, which is a specialised body of the UN, has no ability to bind or sanction its members. Its annual operating budget, about $2bn in 2019, is smaller than that of many university hospitals, and split among a dizzying array of public health and research projects. The WHO is less like a military general or elected leader with a strong mandate, and more like an underpaid sports coach wary of “losing the dressing room”, who can only get their way by charming, grovelling, cajoling and occasionally pleading with the players to do as they say.</p> <p>The WHO “has been drained of power and resources”, said Richard Horton, editor of the influential medical journal the Lancet. “Its coordinating authority and capacity are weak. Its ability to direct an international response to a life-threatening epidemic is non-existent.”</p> <p>At the same time, the international order on which the WHO relies is fraying, as aggressive nationalism becomes normalised around the world. “All the previous rules about global norms, public health and understanding of what’s expected in terms of an outbreak has crumbled,” said Lawrence Gostin, director of the WHO Collaborating Center on National and Global Health Law. “None of us know where this is leading.”</p> <h2><strong>* * *</strong></h2> <p>The WHO was born during the moment of hopeful internationalism that followed the chaos of the second world war. The idea of global collaboration in fighting disease was not new – in the 19th century, at periodic International Sanitary Conferences, countries had standardised quarantine procedures for cholera and yellow fever – but the WHO constitution, adopted in 1948, envisioned a far grander global mission, nothing less than “the attainment by all people of the highest possible levels of health”.</p> <p>One of the WHO’s favourite success stories is the role it played in eliminating smallpox, a disease that was still killing millions each year in the 50s, despite the existence of a vaccine. Although the WHO worked on immunisation research, its most vital role was organisational and diplomatic. In 1959, it convinced the Soviet Union to manufacture 25 million vaccine doses, which the WHO would distribute. Not to be left behind, the US donated millions of dollars to vaccination programmes, both directly and through the WHO. By the late 60s, every nation in the UN was sending a detailed weekly report to WHO headquarters on their number of smallpox cases and recent progress. And in 1979, WHO declared smallpox eradicated, a first in world history. The WHO didn’t provide the most money, immunise the most people, or invent key technologies such as the <a href=\"https://www.globalhealthnow.org/object/bifurcated-needle\" title=\"\">bifurcated needle</a>, but it is hard to imagine smallpox having been defeated without it.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"4044c399a9a92c0ce5d57746c8e2d81421beb2e4\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4044c399a9a92c0ce5d57746c8e2d81421beb2e4/0_0_4252_2835/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Posters of WHO chief Tedros Adhanom in Sao Paulo, Brazil last week.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Posters of WHO chief Tedros Adhanom in Sao Paulo, Brazil last week.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Fernando Bizerra Jr/EPA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>If the story of smallpox eradication shows the WHO acting as something like an international ministry of public health, it doesn’t explain its current position as an emergency service, surveying the world for disease outbreaks and springing into action to contain them. That is a more recent addition to its portfolio, which came after a period, in the 80s and 90s, when the WHO seemed to be losing its earlier dynamism. The diseases it was partly created to address – smallpox, yellow fever and the plague – had either been eradicated or were in decline, and it was slow to identify new threats such as HIV/Aids. Under the leadership of Dr Hiroshi Nakajima, from 1988 to 1998, the organisation stagnated, and some member states complained about poor management and alleged petty corruption.</p> <p>Two things happened at the turn of the century that would shape the WHO we now see tackling the Covid-19 crisis. In 1998, the fiery former prime minister of Norway, Dr Gro Harlem Brundtland, was elected director general. And in 2002, a farmer in China’s Guangdong province became sick with a deadly, never-before-seen respiratory disease that quickly spread among the hospital staff who had treated him, and went on to become the first pandemic of the newly globalised 21st century: one that arose suddenly, had no treatment or cure, and spread with the speed and reach of international business.</p> <h2><strong>* * *</strong></h2> <p>Given the WHO’s sprawling structure, vague mandate and reliance on diplomacy, its director general holds immense power to shape it. Even before she took on the role, Brundtland was comfortable on the world stage. “I was already a political leader, and I was used to this kind of authority,” she told me. Like her friend Kofi Annan, the charismatic UN leader, Brundtland believed that international bodies should be prepared to lead when necessary, rather than being bossed around by powerful nations. “If the job is to direct and coordinate global health, it’s not a question of what one or several governments ask you to do,” she said. “We are working for humanity.”</p> <p>Brundtland pushed the WHO to use its local contacts, diplomatic channels and the emerging internet to locate potential outbreaks, all of which made the organisation less reliant on national governments for information. Within just a few years, this strategy proved its worth. In November 2002, when the Chinese government became aware of the first cases of a novel respiratory disease, later named Sars, it failed to alert the WHO. But, as part of Brundtland’s new approach, WHO staff were monitoring Chinese medical message boards and news media anyway, and were aware of what was then thought to be an atypical pneumonia outbreak. Adding to their suspicions, on 10 February 2003, David Heymann, who was then executive director of the WHO’s communicable diseases cluster, received an email from the son of a former WHO staff member in China warning of a “strange contagious disease” that had already killed 100 people, but which was “not allowed to be made known to the public”. The WHO took the information it had to China, which made its first official report to the WHO the next day.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"fc41769b862cdfb9d6ccd578b4bfef561615bef5\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/fc41769b862cdfb9d6ccd578b4bfef561615bef5/0_0_2000_1386/1000.jpg\" alt=\"WHO director-general Gro Harlem Brundtland (centre) gives polio immunisation to a young boy in New Delhi in January 2000.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"693\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">WHO director-general Gro Harlem Brundtland (centre) gives polio immunisation to a young boy in New Delhi in January 2000.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: John Mcconnico/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Although the WHO had no formal powers to monitor and censure its members, Brundtland wasn’t shy about doing so anyway. In the ensuing months she would accuse China of withholding information, claiming that the outbreak might have been contained “if the WHO had been able to help at an earlier stage” and exhorting the Chinese to “let us come in as quickly as possible!” With remarkable speed, China fell in line and shared its data with the WHO. “After her statements to China, no other countries hesitated,” said Heymann.</p> <p>In March 2003, as the disease spread – reaching Hong Kong, Vietnam and then Canada – for the first time in its history, the WHO issued <a href=\"https://www.who.int/mediacentre/news/releases/2003/pr23/en/\" title=\"\">advice against travelling</a> to affected areas. (Before then, the decision to advise on travel had always been left up to member states.) Despite having no formal powers to ground planes, the measures worked. “Passengers and flights dropped dramatically as soon as we issued the recommendations,” said Heymann.</p> <p>Brundtland’s approach was not always popular, and some bridled under this new upstart WHO. “It wasn’t just China,” Brundtland told me. “The mayor of Toronto [Mel Lastman] flew to Geneva to tell us take down the travel recommendation – while at the same time he was not containing the outbreak. He had people with Sars riding around the subway, no contact tracing, no following up. He couldn’t accept we were telling him what to do!”</p> <p>The WHO’s response to Sars was considered a huge success. Fewer than 1,000 people worldwide died of the disease, despite it reaching a total of 26 countries. The pandemic was defeated not with vaccines or medicines, but with NPIs, or “non-pharmaceutical interventions” in WHO parlance: travel warnings, tracking, testing and isolating cases, and a huge information-gathering operation across multiple countries, all made possible by the WHO’s willingness to wield authority that it had, in a sense, created simply by speaking it into existence. “Brundtland did things the WHO had no authority doing. She just did them,” said Fidler. “She sort of used Sars as a way to test drive some very radical changes.”</p> <p>“After Sars, the WHO’s position was essentially: that was great, let’s formalise it,” said Clare Wenham, a professor of global health policy at LSE. In 2005, the WHO drew up a new version of the <a href=\"https://www.who.int/ihr/about/en/\" title=\"\">International Health Regulations (IHR)</a>, the central legal document that all member states are bound by. According to Fidler, the updated IHR, which is in force to this day, is a radical document. It asks its members to prepare for public health threats according to standards set by the WHO, and to report any outbreaks and all subsequent developments. It also allows the WHO to declare a public health emergency of international concern (or PHEIC, pronounced, incredibly, “fake”), using its own information, over the objection of any single country. During an emergency, countries are expected to take the lead from the WHO’s guidelines and report any deviations to the organisation. All of these requirements, bar the reporting of outbreaks, were new.</p> <p>But the document stopped short of giving the WHO real power if states refuse to comply. “The WHO isn’t Nato, it’s not the security council,” said Gian Luca Burci, who was the WHO’s legal counsel until 2018. The US, fixated on bioterrorism after 9/11, supported giving the organisation some extended powers, but was opposed by Brazil, Russia, India and China, which were wary of US influence. There was a general reluctance to hand an international organisation any more power. “WHO members were happy with the actions that were taken during Sars, but there was definitely a sense afterward of ‘What if that was us in China’s spot?’,” explained Catherine Worsnop, a professor at the University of Maryland School of Public Policy. In short: thanks for stopping the pandemic, but we don’t want to be told what to do.</p> <h2><strong>* * *</strong></h2> <p>If the WHO has seemed at times weak or tentative – very un-Brundtland-like – in its handling of the coronavirus crisis, it is partly because of its bruising experiences during the past decade. From 2009 onwards, the WHO faced condemnation from the press and the international community for its handling of successive crises, all during a decade when the financial and diplomatic order that sustained it began to break down.</p> <p>First, there was the outbreak of H1N1, or “swine flu”. The novel influenza virus was discovered in Mexico in March 2009, and by June, when the WHO declared a pandemic, there were more than 28,000 cases in 74 countries. Over the next year, the WHO coordinated the global response – less aggressively than during Sars – and on 10 August 2010, it declared the pandemic over. Almost immediately, the WHO’s approach came under scrutiny. The death toll – 18,500 confirmed deaths worldwide – was far lower than initially expected, particularly given the disease reached more than 200 countries. “Suddenly you have people saying: ‘Wait a minute, you really cried wolf on this,’” says Wenham. The media and several prominent European politicians demanded inquiries as to whether the WHO had mistakenly rung the alarm, and “cost huge amounts of money and frightened people unnecessarily”, as Paul Flynn, the former Labour MP who chaired one of the inquiries, told the Times in 2010.</p> <p>To this day, opinions are split as to whether H1N1 was a crisis headed off, or a false alarm. “The WHO is always at risk of being criticised as doing too much or too little,” said Keiji Fukuda, the former WHO assistant director general who led the H1N1 response. Most of the former WHO staff and academics I spoke with agreed, proposing some version of the following as an iron law of public health: act slowly and you will be criticised for failing to stop preventable deaths; act aggressively and stop an outbreak before it becomes serious, and you will be accused of having overreacted. (After all, in the latter case, nothing too bad happened, so what was the big deal in the first place?)</p> <p>Fidler, who largely approves of WHO’s quick action during H1N1, believes that the backlash led the WHO, which was then under the command of director general Margaret Chan, to become too tentative about calling for action in the future. This was a period when the fallout from the 2008 financial crisis was also starting to take its toll on its budget. “There was a big funding shortfall,” said Andrew Cassels, director of strategy at the WHO between 2008 and 2013. “Cuts made to the emergency response programmes, personnel cuts.” The funding gap stood at nearly $300m in 2012. Entire offices were shut, including a team of social scientists working on pandemic response.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"29cfebe6451704d592d057ee78cfddfd9ae9f240\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/29cfebe6451704d592d057ee78cfddfd9ae9f240/0_0_3000_1800/1000.jpg\" alt=\"WHO staff training nurses to use protective gear in Freetown, Sierra Leone during the 2014 ebola outbreak.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">WHO staff training nurses to use protective gear in Freetown, Sierra Leone during the 2014 ebola outbreak.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Michael Duff/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>When the Ebola outbreak struck west Africa in 2014, the combination of the WHO’s greater caution and reduced budget resulted in disaster. In contrast to the previous pandemic, this time the WHO was slow to act, and was widely perceived to have lost control of the situation. In the end, the US and several other nations <a href=\"https://www.lshtm.ac.uk/newsevents/news/2015/foreign_military_response_crucial_to_ebola.html\" title=\"\">deployed</a> more than 5,000 military personnel at the request of the affected countries, and an ad-hoc UN committee was created to take over responsibilities from the WHO. The outbreak eventually killed 11,310 people, the vast majority in just three countries – Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone – paralysing their health systems for months, and causing panic across the world. Prominent scientists <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/nov/22/experts-criticise-world-health-organisation-who-delay-ebola-outbreak\" title=\"\">judged</a> the WHO’s response an “egregious failure”.</p> <p>Much of the blame fell on Chan herself. She appeared shell-shocked, stressing to the press that the WHO was a technical advisory body, and that it was national governments that had ultimate responsibility for their citizens’ health. “She wanted the WHO to be an apolitical agency – more like technical support. There was a hesitancy there to push the full powers of the WHO,” said Sara Davies, a professor of global health at Griffith University in Australia.</p> <p>The bold, proactive culture established after Sars had seemingly faded. Fidler believes that by delaying calling Ebola an emergency, and thus failing to organise an international response at a crucial moment, the WHO’s leadership had shown they “no longer had any faith in their authority”.</p> <h2><strong>* * *</strong></h2> <p>Today, under Tedros, the WHO finds itself in uncharted territory. Not only is it facing by far the biggest pandemic in its history, it is also having to defend itself from the nations on which it most depends. “In my 25-plus years of working on global health issues, I cannot recall the leader of a prominent developed country threatening to punish WHO in the manner President Trump did,” said Fidler, referring to the recent press conference in which Trump suggested putting “a very powerful hold” on US contributions to the WHO. In the same press conference, Trump accused the WHO of concealing information, being too slow to react to the virus, and, above all, showing favouritism towards China.</p> <p>Since the crisis began, Tedros has been repeatedly accused of being soft on China. Senator Marco Rubio recently <a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/politics/bolton-joins-calls-for-who-directors-resignation-accomplice-to-chinas-massive-coverup\" title=\"\">told</a> Fox News that the Chinese government had “used the WHO to mislead the world”, and claimed that the WHO “is either complicit or dangerously incompetent”. The US senator Rick Scott put it more bluntly, accusing the WHO of “helping Communist China cover up a global pandemic”. (Tedros, meanwhile, has warned of the dangers of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global/video/2020/apr/09/politicising-covid-19-like-playing-with-fire-who-director-general-says-after-trump-attack-video\">politicising the virus</a>.)</p> <p>Until very recently, the WHO was seen as a relatively neutral arena for China to extend its power. “China likes to find ways within the global system to give it a leading and benevolent image. The WHO was an uncontroversial place to do it,” said Rana Mitter, the director of the University of Oxford China Centre. No longer. The extent of the initial coverup is still unclear, but there is no question that at least at the local level, Chinese officials knew about the outbreak of a novel disease for weeks before it was reported to the WHO. During that time, Chinese doctors were prevented from speaking out.</p> <p>John MacKenzie, the WHO’s emergency committee adviser, told me that the organisation was “a little misled” about the Wuhan outbreak. He says that by the time the government alerted the WHO on 31 December, scientists in China had already determined via genome sequencing that the outbreak was caused by coronavirus. Yet the government didn’t confirm that until 7 January and the full genome sequence was not officially shared until 12 January. “That’s very slow,” MacKenzie told me. “For at least two weeks, we could have been making far more kits and so on for testing.” MacKenzie added that the number of cases officially declared by the Chinese in the first week – 59 in the week ending 5 January – was “nowhere near as many cases as you’d expect”. (The statistics released by the Chinese government continue to be questioned, with some <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/03/world/asia/coronavirus-china-grief-deaths.html?auth=login-email&amp;login=email\" title=\"\">reports</a> suggesting they may have seriously understated the number of coronavirus deaths.)</p> <p>Despite mounting frustrations – in mid-January, China also refused the WHO’s request to send a team of scientific observers to Hubei province, the centre of the outbreak – Tedros has never come close to doing what Brundtland did and calling China out. Instead, on 28 January, he had a closed-door meeting with Xi Jinping in Beijing, and two days later, he praised Chinese efforts to contain the disease, declaring that China is “setting a new standard for outbreak control”. That same day, 30 January, the WHO declared a Pheic, and began issuing prescriptions to countries around the world. On 8 February, China finally allowed WHO observers into the country. For Tedros’s supporters, this was vindication of his strategy of keeping China onside. For his critics, it was too little, too late.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"10a09ac53b686e3d6a7da5a1660151fdfce8847e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/10a09ac53b686e3d6a7da5a1660151fdfce8847e/0_177_3996_2398/1000.jpg\" alt=\"WHO director-general Adhanom Ghebreyesus with Chinese President Xi Jinping in Beijing on 28 January 2020.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">WHO director-general Adhanom Ghebreyesus with Chinese President Xi Jinping in Beijing on 28 January 2020.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Naohiko Hatta/AFP via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Elected as WHO director general in July 2017, Tedros was supported by a bloc of African and Asian countries, including China, which has considerable influence with those members. (Tedros is himself from Ethiopia, where he served as health minister and then foreign minister between 2005 and 2016.) It was a “really nasty” election, said Davies, in which the powers that have traditionally shaped the WHO, such as the US, UK and Canada, lent their support to one of Tedros’s rivals, the British doctor David Nabarro. During the campaign, Tedros was criticised for having served in a repressive government with a poor human rights record, and one of Nabarro’s backers even <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/may/23/who-elects-first-ever-african-director-general-after-tense-vote-tedros-adhanom-ghebreyesus\" title=\"\">accused</a> Tedros of covering up a cholera epidemic during his time as health minister. (Tedros <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/13/health/candidate-who-director-general-ethiopia-cholera-outbreaks.html\" title=\"\">denied the</a> claim, describing it as a “last-minute smear campaign”, while Nabarro told the New York Times that he had never authorised his team to make this accusation against Tedros.) In response, Tedros’s supporters mounted “a collective pushback”, said Davies, against the UK and its allies, eventually winning out. Tedros became the first director general from a so-called developing country since the Brazilian Dr Marcolino Gomes Candau in 1953.</p> <p>While his background is in politics, Tedros is not forthright or confrontational like Brundtland. In Ethiopia, his political party, the Tigray People’s Liberation Front (TPLF) was mostly comprised of ex-revolutionaries, men that “seemed carved out of a rock”, said Fantu Cheru, a professor at American University and former advisor to the Ethiopian government. Tedros was different – jovial and accessible, said Cheru, and able to make personal connections easily. “He is not very ideological, he believes he can work with anyone,” said Mehari Taddele Maru, a professor at the European University Institute in Florence, Italy. Cheru also sees Tedros as a pragmatist. “He’s not in the Chinese pocket. The Americans in particular wanted to destroy his image. Tedros knows how this game works. You need to have more allies than enemies, and those allies may not have a good track record.”</p> <p>“I don’t think Tedros did anything previous director generals would not have done,” said Anthony Costello, the director of the UCL Institute for Global Health. “He needed a good relationship with China in order to get in.” Even Lawrence Gostin, who has been a prominent critic of Tedros in the past, told me that “his high praise for China is understandable. He is seeking to coax China into cooperation.” He went on to note, though, that this strategy “does risk the credibility of WHO as an objective agency.”</p> <p>If the WHO thought it could sacrifice a bit of its credibility – overlooking China’s obvious blunders in December and January in exchange for its compliance in February – and move on, it was mistaken. The argument over China’s influence has been raging for weeks, not least since the government of Taiwan <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-coronavirus-taiwan/taiwan-says-who-ignored-its-coronavirus-questions-at-start-of-outbreak-idUSKBN21B160\" title=\"\">claimed</a> that the WHO had ignored its own early reports of human-to-human transmission of coronavirus as part of a larger history of appeasing China – which has blocked Taiwan from joining the WHO (and the UN) for decades.</p> <p>Now that Trump, scrambling for an answer to explain why the US now has <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/08/coronavirus-world-map-which-countries-have-most-cases-deaths-covid-19\" title=\"\">more cases</a> of coronavirus than any other nation, has alighted upon the WHO and China as his preferred scapegoats, these questions will not go away. “I don’t think we will see the US government cut off funding,” said Fidler. “But what’s happened with this pandemic – with the WHO caught between the US/China rivalry – is not a good omen for the WHO going forward.”</p> <h2><strong>* * *</strong></h2> <p>While the focus has been on what happened between China and the WHO in January, in epidemiological terms the crisis has moved on. Covid-19 has spread fastest and furthest in the US and Europe, through the very rich nations that largely fund and staff the WHO. Before the outbreak, the WHO struggled to get these same nations to prepare for future pandemics. Now the pandemic is here, and they are at the centre of the crisis, the WHO has been unable to keep them following its advice.</p> <p>Richard Horton of the Lancet said that after the WHO declared a public health emergency, “countries, especially western countries, didn’t listen. Or didn’t seek to understand what was actually taking place in China.” On 5 February, the WHO <a href=\"https://www.who.int/news-room/detail/05-02-2020-us-675-million-needed-for-new-coronavirus-preparedness-and-response-global-plan\" title=\"\">asked for</a> $675m to fund its Coronavirus response through to April. Anthony Costello of UCL said that when he met with Tedros on 4 March, the WHO had received only $1.2m. (Tedros announced last week that the funding goal had finally been reached, around the time the number of worldwide cases passed 1 million.)</p> <p>Even the decision to declare a pandemic on 13 March – a largely rhetorical distinction, since calling a Pheic already requires WHO members to respond – was calculated to wake its member states up. In the UK the Premier League was still playing games, and the previous week the US had held primary election contests. “They declared a pandemic because countries weren’t taking the advice,” said Adam Kamradt-Scott, a professor of global health at the University of Sydney.</p> <p>The WHO stresses that the ideal response to the crisis is relatively simple. Individual states should limit public exposure, especially by tracking and tracing all known cases – a strategy that worked in South Korea and appears to be working in Germany. On an international level, states should share scientific information and resources. These are the mantras Tedros goes back to in his briefings: “Test test test” and “solidarity solidarity solidarity”.</p> <p>But countries have repeatedly ignored WHO advice. In the UK, the response has been erratic, lurching between the WHO’s norms and its own strategies, such as the now-discredited pursuit of “herd immunity”. The US didn’t recommend school closures or avoiding travel until 16 March. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/05/sweden-prepares-to-tighten-coronavirus-measures-as-death-toll-climbs\" title=\"\">In Sweden</a>, restaurants are still open.</p> <p>Many wealthy nations have not only pursued their own national strategies for public health, but have also withdrawn from the globalised world of diplomacy and trade that they themselves set up. Earlier this year, for instance, the NHS <a href=\"https://www.euronews.com/2020/03/06/coronavirus-french-protective-mask-manufacturer-scraps-nhs-order-to-keep-masks-in-france\" title=\"\">ordered</a> millions of masks from a French company named Valmy SAS. But in early March, the French government requisitioned all masks produced within the country, so the masks never reached Britain. This week, Germany <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/03/mask-wars-coronavirus-outbidding-demand\" title=\"\">accused the US</a> of seizing a shipment of masks bound for Berlin from a port in Thailand; while Germany previously <a href=\"https://www.rheinische-anzeigenblaetter.de/region/bonn/beim-us-konzern-3m-zoll-kontrollierte-schutzmasken-und-schutzkleidung-36443358\" title=\"\">sent inspectors</a> to the factory of an American company in Jüchen to ensure their medical masks weren’t being exported against government orders.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/27/inside-the-race-to-develop-a-coronavirus-vaccine-covid-19\">\\'It’s a razor’s edge we’re walking\\': inside the race to develop a coronavirus vaccine</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The WHO is battling against a breakdown in international cooperation that is far beyond its capacity to control. “Governments have retreated to national policies, and this problem predates this crisis,” said Clare Wenham, the health scholar. States have been turning away from international institutions for a long time. The WHO hasn’t driven globalisation in the same way as the WTO or IMF, but in a way it has administered it – quietly promising to take on the outbreaks that arise in an industrialised and interconnected world, and relying on the often unspoken norms of international collaboration that underlie it.</p> <p>Ironically, it is most needed now, at a time when faith in the other administrators and overseers of the global order are in decline – a trend that Covid-19 only seems to be accelerating. “As it’s gone on, you see the WHO becoming less important,” said Wenham. “No one is thinking about reducing the global numbers, only their own. The WHO is a global force, but people aren’t thinking globally.”</p> <p>• Follow the Long Read on Twitter at <a href=\"https://twitter.com/gdnlongread\" title=\"\">@gdnlongread</a>, and sign up to the long read weekly email <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/info/ng-interactive/2017/may/05/sign-up-for-the-long-read-email\" title=\"\">here</a>.</p>',\n",

Even allowing for the overrepresentation of BAME staff in the NHS – <a href=\"https://www.ethnicity-facts-figures.service.gov.uk/workforce-and-business/workforce-diversity/nhs-workforce/latest\">they comprise 44% of medical staff</a> compared with 14% of the population of England and Wales – the fact that they were all from ethnic minorities was “extremely disturbing and worrying”, the BMA chair said.</p> \\n<p>“At face value, it seems hard to see how this can be random – to have the first 10 doctors of all being of BAME background,” Dr Chaand Nagpaul said. “Not only that, we also know that in terms of the BAME population, they make up about a third of those in intensive care. There’s a disproportionate percentage of BAME people getting ill.</p> \\n<p>“We have heard the virus does not discriminate between individuals but there’s no doubt there appears to be a manifest disproportionate severity of infection in BAME people and doctors. This has to be addressed – the government must act now.”</p> \\n<p>As well as the 10 doctors, three out of six nurses named as having died have also been BAME as was a hospital pharmacist and at least one healthcare assistant. The overall death figures in the UK have not been broken down by ethnicity but early research published this week showed that<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/07/bame-groups-hit-harder-covid-19-than-white-people-uk\"> 35% of almost 2,000 patients in intensive care units were non-white</a>.</p> \\n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"070e1ce7-43bd-462f-80b5-0be91d966238\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \\n  <div>\\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/XPF35H9RLNE?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\\n  </div>\\n </gu-atom> \\n</figure> \\n<h2>Nagpaul said BAME health professionals were understandably concerned about the deaths of their colleagues and what it might mean for them. The BMA chair said it might be too early to get firm answers but that it needed to be investigated.</h2> \\n<p>Among the factors he speculated could be contributing was whether BAME doctors felt less able to complain about inadequate personal protective equipment (PPE) – <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/06/nhs-doctors-lacking-ppe-bullied-into-treating-covid-19-patients\">a recurring complaint among healthcare workers during the crisis</a> – thereby putting themselves in danger.</p> \\n<p>“<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jun/02/black-nhs-staff-more-likely-bullied-than-white-colleagues\">BAME doctors often feel bullied and harassed at higher levels</a> compared to their white counterparts,” he said. “They are twice as likely not to raise concerns because of fears of recrimination.”</p> \\n<p>He said the death of BAME doctors was particularly upsetting because of “the vast majority – I think only one was born here – who have come from overseas and have given their lives to the NHS, to save the lives of others”.</p> \\n<p>Among the wider BAME population, he suggested the fact that many were in key worker roles, combined with their living arrangements, could be contributing to their disproportionate presence in intensive care units.</p> \\n<p>“You’ve got a high proportion of BAME people not able to stay at home, serving the nation, putting themselves at risk,” he said. “If you add that to overcrowded and multigenerational occupancies, the infections can be brought back home and spread to other members of the family.”</p> \\n<p>Nagpaul questioned whether enough was being done in terms of translating information leaflets about Covid-19 and physical distancing for people for whom English is a second language, suggesting mosques and temples could be used by the government to help relay the message.

Tests on the blood of 175 patients who had been discharged from hospitals in Shanghai revealed that neutralising antibodies – those that can wipe out the virus – usually arose 10 to 15 days after the onset of illness and targeted three different parts of the “spike” protein on the virus’s surface.</p> \\n<p>While older patients produced the highest levels of neutralising antibodies, many patients had low levels and 10 did not appear to generate them at all. If the findings hold up – the study has yet to be reviewed and published – they have widespread implications. The more robust immune response from older people suggests their blood plasma may work best in trials that are assessing whether <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2020/mar/29/coronavirus-survivors-blood-plasma-could-be-used-to-fight-infection\">convalescent plasma</a> infusions can help seriously ill patients overcome the virus. But the findings may frustrate <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2020/apr/08/health-minister-defends-uk-coronavirus-testing-approach-chris-whitty-germany-covid-19\">efforts to manufacture an accurate antibody test</a> for the virus if many people have low or even non-existent levels of neutralising antibodies.

The organisation conceded that people without symptoms can spread the virus, but only recommended healthy people wear face masks when they were caring for a coronavirus patient and in the same room. The masks can help prevent infections by catching large virus-laden droplets that are expelled from patients when they cough and sneeze, but <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/apr/03/face-masks-coronavirus-scientists-evidence-covid-19-public\">David Heymann</a>, who chairs the WHO’s risk committee, said face masks can give people a false sense of security if they do not combine an effective one with eye protection and adopt strict hand hygiene measures.</p> \\n<p>The UK has a similar stance to the WHO and does not recommend healthy people wear masks in public. But the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) not only <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/prevent-getting-sick/cloth-face-cover.html\">advises people to wear face masks</a> outside, but offers guidance on how to make “cloth face coverings” too. On Tuesday, US government scientists argued the case for face coverings after <a href=\"https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.02.20051177v1\">preliminary research</a> showed people spray out thousands of tiny saliva droplets when they speak simple sentences such as “stay healthy”.

On Wednesday, China, lifted its 11-week lockdown in Wuhan where the outbreak began. The following day, the Czech Republic allowed bicycle shops and DIY, hobby and hardware stores to reopen. After the Easter break, Austria will let small shops, DIY stores and garden centres return to business, while Denmark plans to reopen kindergartens and primary schools. But with the virus still present and large numbers of people still vulnerable to infection, health officials are watching closely for cases to surge again.

Separate teams at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai in New York City and New York University reached similar conclusions after studying the genetic code of viruses obtained from patients in the region. The scientists traced the origins of the outbreak by analysing patterns of mutations that accumulate in viruses as they spread. “The majority is clearly European,” Harm van Bakel, a geneticist from one of the teams, told the <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/08/science/new-york-coronavirus-cases-europe-genomes.html\">New York Times</a>.

      "{'byline': 'Zania Stamataki', 'body': '<p>As the daughter of an air force officer and a nurse, I am fascinated by defence systems. There is none more impressive than the human immune system, equipped as it is with a rich arsenal to defend against different types of pathogen. Viruses have evolved to trick, bypass and evade these defences. Our immune systems have, in turn, learned to recognise and deter these virus stealth tactics. In Covid-19, the enemy is a tiny piece of genetic material wearing a lipid coat and a protein crown.</p> <p>So how is our immune system able to defend against viral infections, and how does this apply to Covid-19? The virus that causes Covid-19 is called severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (Sars-Cov-2), and was first detected in humans around five months ago. It is a coronavirus. “Corona”, in Latin, means crown. The virus is adorned with an outer layer of protein covered in spikes, like a crown. These spikes help the virus attach itself to target cells. The research community is<strong> </strong>fast learning about immunity to Covid-19, and we are also applying our knowledge of similar respiratory viruses to predict what to expect in this infection.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Importantly, Covid-19 cannot gain entry to our homes or bodies by itself – we have to let it in</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Think of a virus as a robot; it cannot reproduce so it needs a factory of materials – proteins, lipids and nucleotides –<strong> </strong>to build copies of itself. The coat allows the virus to attach itself to the target cell’s membrane. The virus then fuses with the cell and releases a<strong> </strong>shopping list of instructions<strong> </strong>on how to build and assemble new viruses. This shopping list, the virus genome, is written in nucleotides (RNA). The first job of a virus that enters our bodies is to invade target cells so that it can comfortably remove its coat and deploy its RNA.</p> <p>Once inside, the virus commandeers the cell and borrows cellular machinery<strong> </strong>to build more viruses before immune cells detect the intruders and raise the alarm. Antibody proteins that are able to stick to the virus-spike proteins, and prevent attachment to the target cells, are called neutralising antibodies: generating them is often the goal of protective vaccination.</p> <p>Our infected cells make the ultimate sacrifice and invite their own destruction by displaying distress signals for<strong> </strong>T-cells, which swiftly detect and kill them. T-cells are cytotoxic – powerful serial killers that can recognise peptide fragments of virus displayed on the infected cell surface. When they do, they release a payload of toxic enzymes that kill the infected cell in a “kiss of death”. This strategic martyrdom is organised by the immune system to deprive the virus of its replication factories and can lead to the reduction of viral load in the patient. It takes several days for antiviral T-cells to expand and antibodies to be generated. Here’s the silver lining<strong>:</strong> memory cells ensure that if we encounter the same virus again, we can react immediately with pre-existing defences. Sars-Cov-2 is new to humanity so we have no protective immunological memory. Vaccines prepared using harmless parts of the virus can help us build protective memory.</p> <p>The virus’s enemy superpower is spreading. The virus achieves this through “shedding” from infected patients. Sars-Cov-2 is expert at hopping from person to person, and in some people, it achieves a stealthy existence with mild or no symptoms. Once many copies of the virus are made, it needs to jump to another host. It hitches a ride on droplets that can be coughed or sneezed to a distance of up to two metres. Droplets can survive on surfaces for several hours enabling pick<strong>-</strong>up by a new host, or they can be directly inhaled if another person is in close proximity. Studies are emerging into <a href=\"https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2020/03/should-pets-be-tested-coronavirus\">animal hosts</a> – so far the virus has been detected in a few ferrets, cats, tigers and dogs. No animal deaths have yet been reported, and we don’t know if animals can transmit back to humans.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/21/coronavirus-vaccine-scientist-what-needs-to-be-done-now-hanneke-schuitemaker\">Vaccine scientist: ‘Everything is so new in dealing with this coronavirus’</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The age differential in fatalities for Covid-19 suggests, with some exceptions, that a healthy immune system is usually able to control infection. Meanwhile, an ageing or weakened immune system may struggle to deploy a protective arsenal. Importantly, Sars-Cov-2 cannot gain entry to our homes or bodies by itself – we have to let it in. This is why official advice has centred around<strong> </strong>cleaning our hands and avoiding touching our faces.</p> <p>We know that a healthy immune system is usually able to eliminate infection in a couple of weeks. However, we have no understanding of the components of our immune arsenal that contribute to this feat: some vaccines work by creating potent neutralising antibodies; other vaccines generate powerful memory T-cells. Antiviral antibodies emerge as early as three to four days after virus detection, but are they protective against future reinfection? We believe that antibodies to other coronaviruses (Sars, Mers) last from one to three years. Because this is a new virus, we don’t yet know the answer to this question. Public Health England is <a href=\"https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/878121/coronavirus-covid-19-testing-strategy.pdf\">recruiting</a> 16,000 to 20,000 volunteers to monitor antibodies once a month for six to 12 months to confirm whether we can generate long-lasting antibody responses to Sars-Cov-2. Determining the quality of these antibodies will be important to understanding long-term protection.</p> <p>What is our most potent immune weapon against Covid-19? <a href=\"https://twitter.com/bertoletti_lab/status/1247015473683632129\">Cytotoxic T-cells</a> may play an important role. Immunologists and virologists are working together to discover the correlates of protection, to design vaccines that offer long-term defences against Covid-19. Years of investment in research means that we can use existing approaches to respond to this new threat, and early mobilisation of research funders, philanthropists and academics are diverting resources to bolster these efforts on an unprecedented scale. Experience has taught us that vaccines are able to eradicate infections from this planet (for instance, smallpox), and medicines against viruses that don’t embed their genetic material to our own (for example, hepatitis C) can also achieve this.</p> <p>Our secret weapon is research. Scientists are working hard on understanding Covid-19, and collaboration is key to this effort. But until a vaccine or treatment is available, we ought to work hard to protect ourselves and our families: isolate and prevent transmission by using physical distancing, face masks and sensible hygiene. If we all do our part, this little virus holding the world to ransom won’t stand a chance.</p> <p>• Zania Stamataki is a senior lecturer and researcher in viral immunology at the University of Birmingham</p>', 'wordcount': '1053'}\n",

Scores of often inexperienced staff have been hired in huge numbers in only a few days, posing challenges for the employees and companies involved.</p> <p>The call handler, who asked not to be named for fear of losing his job, said: “Managers, floorwalkers and staff have all been thrown into this with very, very basic training and there are a lot of situations that we aren’t prepared for.”</p> <p>The agency worker said staff with potential Covid-19 symptoms, such as a persistent cough, were coming into work as they could not afford to live on the statutory sick pay (SSP) of £96 a week: “There are lots of people coughing around the call centre who haven’t been self-isolating because there is no guarantee of our jobs being there when we come back… Most of us can’t survive on SSP.”</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Callout callout-coronavirus-key-workers\">  <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div data-callout-tagname=&quot;callout-coronavirus-key-workers&quot;&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Callout&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;callout-coronavirus-key-workers&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>Concerns have also been raised by staff at the Teleperformance’s offices in Manchester and <a href=\"https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/politics/fearful-scots-call-centre-staff-21769687\">in Scotland</a>. The French company, which is one of the government’s biggest call centre operators, said more than half of its nearly 7,000 call handlers were working from home and that the health, safety and security of its staff “has always been our top priority”. It said it had ordered hundreds of thousands of masks for employees and that cleaning of communal areas had increased from once a week to twice daily.</p> <p>Gary Slade, the company’s UK chief executive, said it was “fully compliant” with the government’s sick pay guidelines and that anyone who displayed Covid-19 symptoms was being sent home to self-isolate. “This is not about making money [or] treating people badly – we’ve never been that way,” he added. “But this is definitely without doubt our number one priority: do what’s right for our people and that’s what we’re doing.</p> <p>“Are we perfect? Probably not. There’s always room for improvement. But we’re doing everything we can, working as hard and as fast as we can.”</p> <p>The Guardian found several outsourcing firms recruiting NHS 111 operators for as little as <a href=\"https://www.reed.co.uk/jobs/111-call-handler/40211636?source=details.similarjobs\">£9.09 an hour</a> – barely above the UK minimum wage – despite their role as the first point of contact for people who think they have the coronavirus. One outsourcing firm <a href=\"https://www.reed.co.uk/jobs/home/view/40183565\">said</a> in its job advertisement that no previous customer service experience was needed, adding: “Your personality is far more important than your previous experience.”</p> <p>Concerns have been raised by NHS 111 operators at another firm, Sitel. The Labour MP Luke Pollard said he had received complaints from “dozens” of staff employed at the firm’s call centre in Plymouth, which is handling 111 calls. Staff told him they were working “desk to desk”, in breach of the coronavirus physical distancing rules, and that workplaces were not being deep-cleaned, leaving many afraid to go to work for fear of catching the virus.</p> <p>The company, which is owned by one of the world’s richest families, is said to have instructed call handlers not to speak to the media about their concerns. Pollard said: “If you’re scared of going to work, that is as real as it can get and that needs to be addressed.”</p> <p>Sitel declined to answer a series of questions when contacted by the Guardian. A spokeswoman confirmed that the company was in dialogue with Pollard and that it was following the safety measures outlined on <a href=\"https://www.sitel.com/covid-19-updates/\">its website</a>.</p>', 'wordcount': '734'}\n",

For some reason, funded largely by the United States, yet very China centric,” <a href=\"https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1247540701291638787\" title=\"\">tweeted</a> Donald Trump on 7 April, summing up just one of the many lines of criticism the WHO is currently facing. It is not just Trump – even some of the WHO’s supporters in government, academia and NGOs argue that since the start of the coronavirus crisis, it has caved in to nationalist bullies, praised draconian quarantine measures and failed to protect the liberal international order of which it is a linchpin. “You’ve got a situation where it looks like WHO doesn’t want to exercise its authority,” said David Fidler, a fellow in global health at the Council on Foreign Relations and a regular consultant to the WHO.</p> <p>Meanwhile, the WHO is desperately struggling to get its 194 member states to actually follow its guidance. The WHO’s leaders are “very frustrated,” said John MacKenzie, a virologist and adviser on the WHO’s <a href=\"https://www.who.int/ihr/procedures/novel-coronavirus-2019/ec-22012020-members/en/\" title=\"\">emergency committee</a>. “The messages come out loud and clear, and some disregard the warnings. The US largely did, the UK largely did.”</p> <p>On 11 March, the day Tedros declared the coronavirus a pandemic, he spoke darkly of “alarming levels of inaction” from many countries. Pressed by journalists to name them, Mike Ryan, the usually no-nonsense Irish trauma doctor who heads the WHO’s Covid-19 response, demurred. “You know who you are,” he said, adding that “we don’t criticise our member states in public”.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"f5d9b5d69d079af3d45a26a68aba8a4108aca8e6\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f5d9b5d69d079af3d45a26a68aba8a4108aca8e6/0_100_4554_2732/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Donald Trump at a coronavirus task force briefing at the White House on April 08, 2020 in Washington, DC.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Donald Trump at a coronavirus task force briefing at the White House.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>There is a simple reason for this. For all the responsibility vested in the WHO, it has little power. Unlike international bodies such as the World Trade Organization, the WHO, which is a specialised body of the UN, has no ability to bind or sanction its members. Its annual operating budget, about $2bn in 2019, is smaller than that of many university hospitals, and split among a dizzying array of public health and research projects. The WHO is less like a military general or elected leader with a strong mandate, and more like an underpaid sports coach wary of “losing the dressing room”, who can only get their way by charming, grovelling, cajoling and occasionally pleading with the players to do as they say.</p> <p>The WHO “has been drained of power and resources”, said Richard Horton, editor of the influential medical journal the Lancet. “Its coordinating authority and capacity are weak. Its ability to direct an international response to a life-threatening epidemic is non-existent.”</p> <p>At the same time, the international order on which the WHO relies is fraying, as aggressive nationalism becomes normalised around the world. “All the previous rules about global norms, public health and understanding of what’s expected in terms of an outbreak has crumbled,” said Lawrence Gostin, director of the WHO Collaborating Center on National and Global Health Law. “None of us know where this is leading.”</p> <h2><strong>* * *</strong></h2> <p>The WHO was born during the moment of hopeful internationalism that followed the chaos of the second world war. The idea of global collaboration in fighting disease was not new – in the 19th century, at periodic International Sanitary Conferences, countries had standardised quarantine procedures for cholera and yellow fever – but the WHO constitution, adopted in 1948, envisioned a far grander global mission, nothing less than “the attainment by all people of the highest possible levels of health”.</p> <p>One of the WHO’s favourite success stories is the role it played in eliminating smallpox, a disease that was still killing millions each year in the 50s, despite the existence of a vaccine. Although the WHO worked on immunisation research, its most vital role was organisational and diplomatic. In 1959, it convinced the Soviet Union to manufacture 25 million vaccine doses, which the WHO would distribute. Not to be left behind, the US donated millions of dollars to vaccination programmes, both directly and through the WHO. By the late 60s, every nation in the UN was sending a detailed weekly report to WHO headquarters on their number of smallpox cases and recent progress. And in 1979, WHO declared smallpox eradicated, a first in world history. The WHO didn’t provide the most money, immunise the most people, or invent key technologies such as the <a href=\"https://www.globalhealthnow.org/object/bifurcated-needle\" title=\"\">bifurcated needle</a>, but it is hard to imagine smallpox having been defeated without it.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"4044c399a9a92c0ce5d57746c8e2d81421beb2e4\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4044c399a9a92c0ce5d57746c8e2d81421beb2e4/0_0_4252_2835/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Posters of WHO chief Tedros Adhanom in Sao Paulo, Brazil last week.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Posters of WHO chief Tedros Adhanom in Sao Paulo, Brazil last week.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Fernando Bizerra Jr/EPA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>If the story of smallpox eradication shows the WHO acting as something like an international ministry of public health, it doesn’t explain its current position as an emergency service, surveying the world for disease outbreaks and springing into action to contain them. That is a more recent addition to its portfolio, which came after a period, in the 80s and 90s, when the WHO seemed to be losing its earlier dynamism. The diseases it was partly created to address – smallpox, yellow fever and the plague – had either been eradicated or were in decline, and it was slow to identify new threats such as HIV/Aids. Under the leadership of Dr Hiroshi Nakajima, from 1988 to 1998, the organisation stagnated, and some member states complained about poor management and alleged petty corruption.</p> <p>Two things happened at the turn of the century that would shape the WHO we now see tackling the Covid-19 crisis. In 1998, the fiery former prime minister of Norway, Dr Gro Harlem Brundtland, was elected director general. And in 2002, a farmer in China’s Guangdong province became sick with a deadly, never-before-seen respiratory disease that quickly spread among the hospital staff who had treated him, and went on to become the first pandemic of the newly globalised 21st century: one that arose suddenly, had no treatment or cure, and spread with the speed and reach of international business.</p> <h2><strong>* * *</strong></h2> <p>Given the WHO’s sprawling structure, vague mandate and reliance on diplomacy, its director general holds immense power to shape it. Even before she took on the role, Brundtland was comfortable on the world stage. “I was already a political leader, and I was used to this kind of authority,” she told me. Like her friend Kofi Annan, the charismatic UN leader, Brundtland believed that international bodies should be prepared to lead when necessary, rather than being bossed around by powerful nations. “If the job is to direct and coordinate global health, it’s not a question of what one or several governments ask you to do,” she said. “We are working for humanity.”</p> <p>Brundtland pushed the WHO to use its local contacts, diplomatic channels and the emerging internet to locate potential outbreaks, all of which made the organisation less reliant on national governments for information. Within just a few years, this strategy proved its worth. In November 2002, when the Chinese government became aware of the first cases of a novel respiratory disease, later named Sars, it failed to alert the WHO. But, as part of Brundtland’s new approach, WHO staff were monitoring Chinese medical message boards and news media anyway, and were aware of what was then thought to be an atypical pneumonia outbreak. Adding to their suspicions, on 10 February 2003, David Heymann, who was then executive director of the WHO’s communicable diseases cluster, received an email from the son of a former WHO staff member in China warning of a “strange contagious disease” that had already killed 100 people, but which was “not allowed to be made known to the public”. The WHO took the information it had to China, which made its first official report to the WHO the next day.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"fc41769b862cdfb9d6ccd578b4bfef561615bef5\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/fc41769b862cdfb9d6ccd578b4bfef561615bef5/0_0_2000_1386/1000.jpg\" alt=\"WHO director-general Gro Harlem Brundtland (centre) gives polio immunisation to a young boy in New Delhi in January 2000.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"693\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">WHO director-general Gro Harlem Brundtland (centre) gives polio immunisation to a young boy in New Delhi in January 2000.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: John Mcconnico/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Although the WHO had no formal powers to monitor and censure its members, Brundtland wasn’t shy about doing so anyway. In the ensuing months she would accuse China of withholding information, claiming that the outbreak might have been contained “if the WHO had been able to help at an earlier stage” and exhorting the Chinese to “let us come in as quickly as possible!” With remarkable speed, China fell in line and shared its data with the WHO. “After her statements to China, no other countries hesitated,” said Heymann.</p> <p>In March 2003, as the disease spread – reaching Hong Kong, Vietnam and then Canada – for the first time in its history, the WHO issued <a href=\"https://www.who.int/mediacentre/news/releases/2003/pr23/en/\" title=\"\">advice against travelling</a> to affected areas. (Before then, the decision to advise on travel had always been left up to member states.) Despite having no formal powers to ground planes, the measures worked. “Passengers and flights dropped dramatically as soon as we issued the recommendations,” said Heymann.</p> <p>Brundtland’s approach was not always popular, and some bridled under this new upstart WHO. “It wasn’t just China,” Brundtland told me. “The mayor of Toronto [Mel Lastman] flew to Geneva to tell us take down the travel recommendation – while at the same time he was not containing the outbreak. He had people with Sars riding around the subway, no contact tracing, no following up. He couldn’t accept we were telling him what to do!”</p> <p>The WHO’s response to Sars was considered a huge success. Fewer than 1,000 people worldwide died of the disease, despite it reaching a total of 26 countries. The pandemic was defeated not with vaccines or medicines, but with NPIs, or “non-pharmaceutical interventions” in WHO parlance: travel warnings, tracking, testing and isolating cases, and a huge information-gathering operation across multiple countries, all made possible by the WHO’s willingness to wield authority that it had, in a sense, created simply by speaking it into existence. “Brundtland did things the WHO had no authority doing. She just did them,” said Fidler. “She sort of used Sars as a way to test drive some very radical changes.”</p> <p>“After Sars, the WHO’s position was essentially: that was great, let’s formalise it,” said Clare Wenham, a professor of global health policy at LSE. In 2005, the WHO drew up a new version of the <a href=\"https://www.who.int/ihr/about/en/\" title=\"\">International Health Regulations (IHR)</a>, the central legal document that all member states are bound by. According to Fidler, the updated IHR, which is in force to this day, is a radical document. It asks its members to prepare for public health threats according to standards set by the WHO, and to report any outbreaks and all subsequent developments. It also allows the WHO to declare a public health emergency of international concern (or PHEIC, pronounced, incredibly, “fake”), using its own information, over the objection of any single country. During an emergency, countries are expected to take the lead from the WHO’s guidelines and report any deviations to the organisation. All of these requirements, bar the reporting of outbreaks, were new.</p> <p>But the document stopped short of giving the WHO real power if states refuse to comply. “The WHO isn’t Nato, it’s not the security council,” said Gian Luca Burci, who was the WHO’s legal counsel until 2018. The US, fixated on bioterrorism after 9/11, supported giving the organisation some extended powers, but was opposed by Brazil, Russia, India and China, which were wary of US influence. There was a general reluctance to hand an international organisation any more power. “WHO members were happy with the actions that were taken during Sars, but there was definitely a sense afterward of ‘What if that was us in China’s spot?’,” explained Catherine Worsnop, a professor at the University of Maryland School of Public Policy. In short: thanks for stopping the pandemic, but we don’t want to be told what to do.</p> <h2><strong>* * *</strong></h2> <p>If the WHO has seemed at times weak or tentative – very un-Brundtland-like – in its handling of the coronavirus crisis, it is partly because of its bruising experiences during the past decade. From 2009 onwards, the WHO faced condemnation from the press and the international community for its handling of successive crises, all during a decade when the financial and diplomatic order that sustained it began to break down.</p> <p>First, there was the outbreak of H1N1, or “swine flu”. The novel influenza virus was discovered in Mexico in March 2009, and by June, when the WHO declared a pandemic, there were more than 28,000 cases in 74 countries. Over the next year, the WHO coordinated the global response – less aggressively than during Sars – and on 10 August 2010, it declared the pandemic over. Almost immediately, the WHO’s approach came under scrutiny. The death toll – 18,500 confirmed deaths worldwide – was far lower than initially expected, particularly given the disease reached more than 200 countries. “Suddenly you have people saying: ‘Wait a minute, you really cried wolf on this,’” says Wenham. The media and several prominent European politicians demanded inquiries as to whether the WHO had mistakenly rung the alarm, and “cost huge amounts of money and frightened people unnecessarily”, as Paul Flynn, the former Labour MP who chaired one of the inquiries, told the Times in 2010.</p> <p>To this day, opinions are split as to whether H1N1 was a crisis headed off, or a false alarm. “The WHO is always at risk of being criticised as doing too much or too little,” said Keiji Fukuda, the former WHO assistant director general who led the H1N1 response. Most of the former WHO staff and academics I spoke with agreed, proposing some version of the following as an iron law of public health: act slowly and you will be criticised for failing to stop preventable deaths; act aggressively and stop an outbreak before it becomes serious, and you will be accused of having overreacted. (After all, in the latter case, nothing too bad happened, so what was the big deal in the first place?)</p> <p>Fidler, who largely approves of WHO’s quick action during H1N1, believes that the backlash led the WHO, which was then under the command of director general Margaret Chan, to become too tentative about calling for action in the future. This was a period when the fallout from the 2008 financial crisis was also starting to take its toll on its budget. “There was a big funding shortfall,” said Andrew Cassels, director of strategy at the WHO between 2008 and 2013. “Cuts made to the emergency response programmes, personnel cuts.” The funding gap stood at nearly $300m in 2012. Entire offices were shut, including a team of social scientists working on pandemic response.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"29cfebe6451704d592d057ee78cfddfd9ae9f240\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/29cfebe6451704d592d057ee78cfddfd9ae9f240/0_0_3000_1800/1000.jpg\" alt=\"WHO staff training nurses to use protective gear in Freetown, Sierra Leone during the 2014 ebola outbreak.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">WHO staff training nurses to use protective gear in Freetown, Sierra Leone during the 2014 ebola outbreak.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Michael Duff/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>When the Ebola outbreak struck west Africa in 2014, the combination of the WHO’s greater caution and reduced budget resulted in disaster.

In the end, the US and several other nations <a href=\"https://www.lshtm.ac.uk/newsevents/news/2015/foreign_military_response_crucial_to_ebola.html\" title=\"\">deployed</a> more than 5,000 military personnel at the request of the affected countries, and an ad-hoc UN committee was created to take over responsibilities from the WHO. The outbreak eventually killed 11,310 people, the vast majority in just three countries – Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone – paralysing their health systems for months, and causing panic across the world. Prominent scientists <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/nov/22/experts-criticise-world-health-organisation-who-delay-ebola-outbreak\" title=\"\">judged</a> the WHO’s response an “egregious failure”.</p> <p>Much of the blame fell on Chan herself. She appeared shell-shocked, stressing to the press that the WHO was a technical advisory body, and that it was national governments that had ultimate responsibility for their citizens’ health. “She wanted the WHO to be an apolitical agency – more like technical support. There was a hesitancy there to push the full powers of the WHO,” said Sara Davies, a professor of global health at Griffith University in Australia.</p> <p>The bold, proactive culture established after Sars had seemingly faded. Fidler believes that by delaying calling Ebola an emergency, and thus failing to organise an international response at a crucial moment, the WHO’s leadership had shown they “no longer had any faith in their authority”.</p> <h2><strong>* * *</strong></h2> <p>Today, under Tedros, the WHO finds itself in uncharted territory. Not only is it facing by far the biggest pandemic in its history, it is also having to defend itself from the nations on which it most depends. “In my 25-plus years of working on global health issues, I cannot recall the leader of a prominent developed country threatening to punish WHO in the manner President Trump did,” said Fidler, referring to the recent press conference in which Trump suggested putting “a very powerful hold” on US contributions to the WHO. In the same press conference, Trump accused the WHO of concealing information, being too slow to react to the virus, and, above all, showing favouritism towards China.</p> <p>Since the crisis began, Tedros has been repeatedly accused of being soft on China. Senator Marco Rubio recently <a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/politics/bolton-joins-calls-for-who-directors-resignation-accomplice-to-chinas-massive-coverup\" title=\"\">told</a> Fox News that the Chinese government had “used the WHO to mislead the world”, and claimed that the WHO “is either complicit or dangerously incompetent”. The US senator Rick Scott put it more bluntly, accusing the WHO of “helping Communist China cover up a global pandemic”. (Tedros, meanwhile, has warned of the dangers of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global/video/2020/apr/09/politicising-covid-19-like-playing-with-fire-who-director-general-says-after-trump-attack-video\">politicising the virus</a>.)</p> <p>Until very recently, the WHO was seen as a relatively neutral arena for China to extend its power. “China likes to find ways within the global system to give it a leading and benevolent image. The WHO was an uncontroversial place to do it,” said Rana Mitter, the director of the University of Oxford China Centre. No longer. The extent of the initial coverup is still unclear, but there is no question that at least at the local level, Chinese officials knew about the outbreak of a novel disease for weeks before it was reported to the WHO. During that time, Chinese doctors were prevented from speaking out.</p> <p>John MacKenzie, the WHO’s emergency committee adviser, told me that the organisation was “a little misled” about the Wuhan outbreak. He says that by the time the government alerted the WHO on 31 December, scientists in China had already determined via genome sequencing that the outbreak was caused by coronavirus. Yet the government didn’t confirm that until 7 January and the full genome sequence was not officially shared until 12 January. “That’s very slow,” MacKenzie told me. “For at least two weeks, we could have been making far more kits and so on for testing.” MacKenzie added that the number of cases officially declared by the Chinese in the first week – 59 in the week ending 5 January – was “nowhere near as many cases as you’d expect”. (The statistics released by the Chinese government continue to be questioned, with some <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/03/world/asia/coronavirus-china-grief-deaths.html?auth=login-email&amp;login=email\" title=\"\">reports</a> suggesting they may have seriously understated the number of coronavirus deaths.)</p> <p>Despite mounting frustrations – in mid-January, China also refused the WHO’s request to send a team of scientific observers to Hubei province, the centre of the outbreak – Tedros has never come close to doing what Brundtland did and calling China out. Instead, on 28 January, he had a closed-door meeting with Xi Jinping in Beijing, and two days later, he praised Chinese efforts to contain the disease, declaring that China is “setting a new standard for outbreak control”. That same day, 30 January, the WHO declared a Pheic, and began issuing prescriptions to countries around the world. On 8 February, China finally allowed WHO observers into the country. For Tedros’s supporters, this was vindication of his strategy of keeping China onside. For his critics, it was too little, too late.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"10a09ac53b686e3d6a7da5a1660151fdfce8847e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/10a09ac53b686e3d6a7da5a1660151fdfce8847e/0_177_3996_2398/1000.jpg\" alt=\"WHO director-general Adhanom Ghebreyesus with Chinese President Xi Jinping in Beijing on 28 January 2020.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">WHO director-general Adhanom Ghebreyesus with Chinese President Xi Jinping in Beijing on 28 January 2020.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Naohiko Hatta/AFP via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Elected as WHO director general in July 2017, Tedros was supported by a bloc of African and Asian countries, including China, which has considerable influence with those members. (Tedros is himself from Ethiopia, where he served as health minister and then foreign minister between 2005 and 2016.) It was a “really nasty” election, said Davies, in which the powers that have traditionally shaped the WHO, such as the US, UK and Canada, lent their support to one of Tedros’s rivals, the British doctor David Nabarro. During the campaign, Tedros was criticised for having served in a repressive government with a poor human rights record, and one of Nabarro’s backers even <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/may/23/who-elects-first-ever-african-director-general-after-tense-vote-tedros-adhanom-ghebreyesus\" title=\"\">accused</a> Tedros of covering up a cholera epidemic during his time as health minister. (Tedros <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/13/health/candidate-who-director-general-ethiopia-cholera-outbreaks.html\" title=\"\">denied the</a> claim, describing it as a “last-minute smear campaign”, while Nabarro told the New York Times that he had never authorised his team to make this accusation against Tedros.) In response, Tedros’s supporters mounted “a collective pushback”, said Davies, against the UK and its allies, eventually winning out. Tedros became the first director general from a so-called developing country since the Brazilian Dr Marcolino Gomes Candau in 1953.</p> <p>While his background is in politics, Tedros is not forthright or confrontational like Brundtland. In Ethiopia, his political party, the Tigray People’s Liberation Front (TPLF) was mostly comprised of ex-revolutionaries, men that “seemed carved out of a rock”, said Fantu Cheru, a professor at American University and former advisor to the Ethiopian government. Tedros was different – jovial and accessible, said Cheru, and able to make personal connections easily. “He is not very ideological, he believes he can work with anyone,” said Mehari Taddele Maru, a professor at the European University Institute in Florence, Italy. Cheru also sees Tedros as a pragmatist. “He’s not in the Chinese pocket. The Americans in particular wanted to destroy his image. Tedros knows how this game works. You need to have more allies than enemies, and those allies may not have a good track record.”</p> <p>“I don’t think Tedros did anything previous director generals would not have done,” said Anthony Costello, the director of the UCL Institute for Global Health. “He needed a good relationship with China in order to get in.” Even Lawrence Gostin, who has been a prominent critic of Tedros in the past, told me that “his high praise for China is understandable. He is seeking to coax China into cooperation.” He went on to note, though, that this strategy “does risk the credibility of WHO as an objective agency.”</p> <p>If the WHO thought it could sacrifice a bit of its credibility – overlooking China’s obvious blunders in December and January in exchange for its compliance in February – and move on, it was mistaken. The argument over China’s influence has been raging for weeks, not least since the government of Taiwan <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-coronavirus-taiwan/taiwan-says-who-ignored-its-coronavirus-questions-at-start-of-outbreak-idUSKBN21B160\" title=\"\">claimed</a> that the WHO had ignored its own early reports of human-to-human transmission of coronavirus as part of a larger history of appeasing China – which has blocked Taiwan from joining the WHO (and the UN) for decades.</p> <p>Now that Trump, scrambling for an answer to explain why the US now has <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/08/coronavirus-world-map-which-countries-have-most-cases-deaths-covid-19\" title=\"\">more cases</a> of coronavirus than any other nation, has alighted upon the WHO and China as his preferred scapegoats, these questions will not go away. “I don’t think we will see the US government cut off funding,” said Fidler. “But what’s happened with this pandemic – with the WHO caught between the US/China rivalry – is not a good omen for the WHO going forward.”</p> <h2><strong>* * *</strong></h2> <p>While the focus has been on what happened between China and the WHO in January, in epidemiological terms the crisis has moved on. Covid-19 has spread fastest and furthest in the US and Europe, through the very rich nations that largely fund and staff the WHO. Before the outbreak, the WHO struggled to get these same nations to prepare for future pandemics. Now the pandemic is here, and they are at the centre of the crisis, the WHO has been unable to keep them following its advice.</p> <p>Richard Horton of the Lancet said that after the WHO declared a public health emergency, “countries, especially western countries, didn’t listen. Or didn’t seek to understand what was actually taking place in China.” On 5 February, the WHO <a href=\"https://www.who.int/news-room/detail/05-02-2020-us-675-million-needed-for-new-coronavirus-preparedness-and-response-global-plan\" title=\"\">asked for</a> $675m to fund its Coronavirus response through to April. Anthony Costello of UCL said that when he met with Tedros on 4 March, the WHO had received only $1.2m. (Tedros announced last week that the funding goal had finally been reached, around the time the number of worldwide cases passed 1 million.)</p> <p>Even the decision to declare a pandemic on 13 March – a largely rhetorical distinction, since calling a Pheic already requires WHO members to respond – was calculated to wake its member states up. In the UK the Premier League was still playing games, and the previous week the US had held primary election contests. “They declared a pandemic because countries weren’t taking the advice,” said Adam Kamradt-Scott, a professor of global health at the University of Sydney.</p> <p>The WHO stresses that the ideal response to the crisis is relatively simple. Individual states should limit public exposure, especially by tracking and tracing all known cases – a strategy that worked in South Korea and appears to be working in Germany. On an international level, states should share scientific information and resources. These are the mantras Tedros goes back to in his briefings: “Test test test” and “solidarity solidarity solidarity”.</p> <p>But countries have repeatedly ignored WHO advice. In the UK, the response has been erratic, lurching between the WHO’s norms and its own strategies, such as the now-discredited pursuit of “herd immunity”. The US didn’t recommend school closures or avoiding travel until 16 March. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/05/sweden-prepares-to-tighten-coronavirus-measures-as-death-toll-climbs\" title=\"\">In Sweden</a>, restaurants are still open.</p> <p>Many wealthy nations have not only pursued their own national strategies for public health, but have also withdrawn from the globalised world of diplomacy and trade that they themselves set up. Earlier this year, for instance, the NHS <a href=\"https://www.euronews.com/2020/03/06/coronavirus-french-protective-mask-manufacturer-scraps-nhs-order-to-keep-masks-in-france\" title=\"\">ordered</a> millions of masks from a French company named Valmy SAS. But in early March, the French government requisitioned all masks produced within the country, so the masks never reached Britain. This week, Germany <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/03/mask-wars-coronavirus-outbidding-demand\" title=\"\">accused the US</a> of seizing a shipment of masks bound for Berlin from a port in Thailand; while Germany previously <a href=\"https://www.rheinische-anzeigenblaetter.de/region/bonn/beim-us-konzern-3m-zoll-kontrollierte-schutzmasken-und-schutzkleidung-36443358\" title=\"\">sent inspectors</a> to the factory of an American company in Jüchen to ensure their medical masks weren’t being exported against government orders.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/27/inside-the-race-to-develop-a-coronavirus-vaccine-covid-19\">\\'It’s a razor’s edge we’re walking\\': inside the race to develop a coronavirus vaccine</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The WHO is battling against a breakdown in international cooperation that is far beyond its capacity to control. “Governments have retreated to national policies, and this problem predates this crisis,” said Clare Wenham, the health scholar. States have been turning away from international institutions for a long time. The WHO hasn’t driven globalisation in the same way as the WTO or IMF, but in a way it has administered it – quietly promising to take on the outbreaks that arise in an industrialised and interconnected world, and relying on the often unspoken norms of international collaboration that underlie it.</p> <p>Ironically, it is most needed now, at a time when faith in the other administrators and overseers of the global order are in decline – a trend that Covid-19 only seems to be accelerating. “As it’s gone on, you see the WHO becoming less important,” said Wenham. “No one is thinking about reducing the global numbers, only their own. The WHO is a global force, but people aren’t thinking globally.”</p> <p>• Follow the Long Read on Twitter at <a href=\"https://twitter.com/gdnlongread\" title=\"\">@gdnlongread</a>, and sign up to the long read weekly email <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/info/ng-interactive/2017/may/05/sign-up-for-the-long-read-email\" title=\"\">here</a>.</p>', 'wordcount': '4573'}\n",
      "{'byline': 'Haroon Siddique', 'body': '<p>The head of the British Medical Association has called on the government to urgently investigate if and why black, Asian and minority ethnic people are more vulnerable to Covid-19, after <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/18/not-ready-to-go-tributes-paid-to-uk-first-named-victims-of-coronavirus\">the first 10 doctors in the UK named as having died from the virus were all BAME</a>.</p> \\n<p>Those doctors have ancestry in regions including Asia, the Middle East and Africa. Even allowing for the overrepresentation of BAME staff in the NHS – <a href=\"https://www.ethnicity-facts-figures.service.gov.uk/workforce-and-business/workforce-diversity/nhs-workforce/latest\">they comprise 44% of medical staff</a> compared with 14% of the population of England and Wales – the fact that they were all from ethnic minorities was “extremely disturbing and worrying”, the BMA chair said.</p> \\n<p>“At face value, it seems hard to see how this can be random – to have the first 10 doctors of all being of BAME background,” Dr Chaand Nagpaul said. “Not only that, we also know that in terms of the BAME population, they make up about a third of those in intensive care. There’s a disproportionate percentage of BAME people getting ill.</p> \\n<p>“We have heard the virus does not discriminate between individuals but there’s no doubt there appears to be a manifest disproportionate severity of infection in BAME people and doctors. This has to be addressed – the government must act now.”</p> \\n<p>As well as the 10 doctors, three out of six nurses named as having died have also been BAME as was a hospital pharmacist and at least one healthcare assistant. The overall death figures in the UK have not been broken down by ethnicity but early research published this week showed that<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/07/bame-groups-hit-harder-covid-19-than-white-people-uk\"> 35% of almost 2,000 patients in intensive care units were non-white</a>.</p> \\n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"070e1ce7-43bd-462f-80b5-0be91d966238\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \\n  <div>\\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/XPF35H9RLNE?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\\n  </div>\\n </gu-atom> \\n</figure> \\n<h2>Nagpaul said BAME health professionals were understandably concerned about the deaths of their colleagues and what it might mean for them. The BMA chair said it might be too early to get firm answers but that it needed to be investigated.</h2> \\n<p>Among the factors he speculated could be contributing was whether BAME doctors felt less able to complain about inadequate personal protective equipment (PPE) – <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/06/nhs-doctors-lacking-ppe-bullied-into-treating-covid-19-patients\">a recurring complaint among healthcare workers during the crisis</a> – thereby putting themselves in danger.</p> \\n<p>“<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jun/02/black-nhs-staff-more-likely-bullied-than-white-colleagues\">BAME doctors often feel bullied and harassed at higher levels</a> compared to their white counterparts,” he said. “They are twice as likely not to raise concerns because of fears of recrimination.”</p> \\n<p>He said the death of BAME doctors was particularly upsetting because of “the vast majority – I think only one was born here – who have come from overseas and have given their lives to the NHS, to save the lives of others”.</p> \\n<p>Among the wider BAME population, he suggested the fact that many were in key worker roles, combined with their living arrangements, could be contributing to their disproportionate presence in intensive care units.</p> \\n<p>“You’ve got a high proportion of BAME people not able to stay at home, serving the nation, putting themselves at risk,” he said. “If you add that to overcrowded and multigenerational occupancies, the infections can be brought back home and spread to other members of the family.”</p> \\n<p>Nagpaul questioned whether enough was being done in terms of translating information leaflets about Covid-19 and physical distancing for people for whom English is a second language, suggesting mosques and temples could be used by the government to help relay the message. He said difficulties speaking English could lead to problems accessing NHS 111 either online or on the phone.</p> \\n<p>Nagpaul also highlighted the higher prevalence of diabetes, heart disease and kidney disease among BAME communities than in the white population, adding: “Previous inequalities will be greater at a time of crisis. This [coronavirus] may be bringing into focus historic inequalities facing BAME communities.”</p> \\n<figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Callout callout-coronavirus\"> <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"<html><head></head><body><div data-callout-tagname=&quot;callout-coronavirus&quot;> <h2>Callout</h2> <p>callout-coronavirus</p> </div></body></html>\"></iframe> \\n</figure> \\n<p>He said the best advice for BAME doctors to protect themselves against Covid-19 until more was known about the virus was the same as for any of their colleagues: ensure they are wearing appropriate PPE. He urged them not to risk their life if it was not forthcoming.</p> \\n<p>“We need to safeguard our BAME population and the BAME medical officers,” he said “These are workers who are <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2019/jun/25/nhs-treating-minority-ethnic-doctors-as-outsiders\">already experiencing significant hardships working for the NHS</a>. They are serving the nation at a time of unprecedented crisis. The government must take steps to address this.”</p> \\n<p>The Department of Health and Social Care said it was working hard to protect all communities, adding that translations of the public information leaflet, posted to all 30 million households in the UK, were <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/coronavirus-covid-19-information-leaflet\">available on its website</a>.</p>', 'wordcount': '734'}\n"

The organisation conceded that people without symptoms can spread the virus, but only recommended healthy people wear face masks when they were caring for a coronavirus patient and in the same room. The masks can help prevent infections by catching large virus-laden droplets that are expelled from patients when they cough and sneeze, but <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/apr/03/face-masks-coronavirus-scientists-evidence-covid-19-public\">David Heymann</a>, who chairs the WHO’s risk committee, said face masks can give people a false sense of security if they do not combine an effective one with eye protection and adopt strict hand hygiene measures.</p> \n",

      "<p>As the daughter of an air force officer and a nurse, I am fascinated by defence systems. There is none more impressive than the human immune system, equipped as it is with a rich arsenal to defend against different types of pathogen. Viruses have evolved to trick, bypass and evade these defences. Our immune systems have, in turn, learned to recognise and deter these virus stealth tactics. In Covid-19, the enemy is a tiny piece of genetic material wearing a lipid coat and a protein crown.</p> <p>So how is our immune system able to defend against viral infections, and how does this apply to Covid-19? The virus that causes Covid-19 is called severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (Sars-Cov-2), and was first detected in humans around five months ago. It is a coronavirus. “Corona”, in Latin, means crown. The virus is adorned with an outer layer of protein covered in spikes, like a crown. These spikes help the virus attach itself to target cells. The research community is<strong> </strong>fast learning about immunity to Covid-19, and we are also applying our knowledge of similar respiratory viruses to predict what to expect in this infection.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Importantly, Covid-19 cannot gain entry to our homes or bodies by itself – we have to let it in</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Think of a virus as a robot; it cannot reproduce so it needs a factory of materials – proteins, lipids and nucleotides –<strong> </strong>to build copies of itself. The coat allows the virus to attach itself to the target cell’s membrane. The virus then fuses with the cell and releases a<strong> </strong>shopping list of instructions<strong> </strong>on how to build and assemble new viruses. This shopping list, the virus genome, is written in nucleotides (RNA). The first job of a virus that enters our bodies is to invade target cells so that it can comfortably remove its coat and deploy its RNA.</p> <p>Once inside, the virus commandeers the cell and borrows cellular machinery<strong> </strong>to build more viruses before immune cells detect the intruders and raise the alarm. Antibody proteins that are able to stick to the virus-spike proteins, and prevent attachment to the target cells, are called neutralising antibodies: generating them is often the goal of protective vaccination.</p> <p>Our infected cells make the ultimate sacrifice and invite their own destruction by displaying distress signals for<strong> </strong>T-cells, which swiftly detect and kill them. T-cells are cytotoxic – powerful serial killers that can recognise peptide fragments of virus displayed on the infected cell surface. When they do, they release a payload of toxic enzymes that kill the infected cell in a “kiss of death”. This strategic martyrdom is organised by the immune system to deprive the virus of its replication factories and can lead to the reduction of viral load in the patient. It takes several days for antiviral T-cells to expand and antibodies to be generated. Here’s the silver lining<strong>:</strong> memory cells ensure that if we encounter the same virus again, we can react immediately with pre-existing defences. Sars-Cov-2 is new to humanity so we have no protective immunological memory. Vaccines prepared using harmless parts of the virus can help us build protective memory.</p> <p>The virus’s enemy superpower is spreading. The virus achieves this through “shedding” from infected patients. Sars-Cov-2 is expert at hopping from person to person, and in some people, it achieves a stealthy existence with mild or no symptoms. Once many copies of the virus are made, it needs to jump to another host. It hitches a ride on droplets that can be coughed or sneezed to a distance of up to two metres. Droplets can survive on surfaces for several hours enabling pick<strong>-</strong>up by a new host, or they can be directly inhaled if another person is in close proximity. Studies are emerging into <a href=\"https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2020/03/should-pets-be-tested-coronavirus\">animal hosts</a> – so far the virus has been detected in a few ferrets, cats, tigers and dogs. No animal deaths have yet been reported, and we don’t know if animals can transmit back to humans.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/21/coronavirus-vaccine-scientist-what-needs-to-be-done-now-hanneke-schuitemaker\">Vaccine scientist: ‘Everything is so new in dealing with this coronavirus’</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The age differential in fatalities for Covid-19 suggests, with some exceptions, that a healthy immune system is usually able to control infection. Meanwhile, an ageing or weakened immune system may struggle to deploy a protective arsenal. Importantly, Sars-Cov-2 cannot gain entry to our homes or bodies by itself – we have to let it in. This is why official advice has centred around<strong> </strong>cleaning our hands and avoiding touching our faces.</p> <p>We know that a healthy immune system is usually able to eliminate infection in a couple of weeks. However, we have no understanding of the components of our immune arsenal that contribute to this feat: some vaccines work by creating potent neutralising antibodies; other vaccines generate powerful memory T-cells. Antiviral antibodies emerge as early as three to four days after virus detection, but are they protective against future reinfection? We believe that antibodies to other coronaviruses (Sars, Mers) last from one to three years. Because this is a new virus, we don’t yet know the answer to this question. Public Health England is <a href=\"https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/878121/coronavirus-covid-19-testing-strategy.pdf\">recruiting</a> 16,000 to 20,000 volunteers to monitor antibodies once a month for six to 12 months to confirm whether we can generate long-lasting antibody responses to Sars-Cov-2. Determining the quality of these antibodies will be important to understanding long-term protection.</p> <p>What is our most potent immune weapon against Covid-19? <a href=\"https://twitter.com/bertoletti_lab/status/1247015473683632129\">Cytotoxic T-cells</a> may play an important role. Immunologists and virologists are working together to discover the correlates of protection, to design vaccines that offer long-term defences against Covid-19. Years of investment in research means that we can use existing approaches to respond to this new threat, and early mobilisation of research funders, philanthropists and academics are diverting resources to bolster these efforts on an unprecedented scale. Experience has taught us that vaccines are able to eradicate infections from this planet (for instance, smallpox), and medicines against viruses that don’t embed their genetic material to our own (for example, hepatitis C) can also achieve this.</p> <p>Our secret weapon is research. Scientists are working hard on understanding Covid-19, and collaboration is key to this effort. But until a vaccine or treatment is available, we ought to work hard to protect ourselves and our families: isolate and prevent transmission by using physical distancing, face masks and sensible hygiene. If we all do our part, this little virus holding the world to ransom won’t stand a chance.</p> <p>• Zania Stamataki is a senior lecturer and researcher in viral immunology at the University of Birmingham</p>\n",

      "<p>Call centre staff at the NHS’s 111 helpline are turning up to work with coronavirus symptoms owing to a lack of adequate sick pay, according to a whistleblower who has filed a complaint to MPs.</p> <p>Concerns about health and safety have been raised by call handlers at at least three call centres where thousands of people are employed by outsourcing firms to field calls to the 111 service.</p> <p>One employee, whose complaint has been published by a commons select committee, told the Guardian that colleagues felt ill-prepared for the mass volume of calls and “terrified” they would catch the virus due to “unsafe” working conditions.</p> <p>The call-handler, who works for the outsourcing firm Teleperformance, said communal equipment including coffee machines, exit buttons and door handles were cleaned only twice a day – which the company does not dispute – and that staff were given only “very, very basic” training on how to handle 111 calls about the coronavirus.</p> <p>The government has asked some of the UK’s biggest private call centre operators to massively scale up their NHS 111 capacity amid a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2020/apr/05/calls-nhs-111-soar-400-since-start-coronavirus-crisis-uk\">400% increase in calls</a> due to the outbreak. Scores of often inexperienced staff have been hired in huge numbers in only a few days, posing challenges for the employees and companies involved.</p> <p>The call handler, who asked not to be named for fear of losing his job, said: “Managers, floorwalkers and staff have all been thrown into this with very, very basic training and there are a lot of situations that we aren’t prepared for.”</p> <p>The agency worker said staff with potential Covid-19 symptoms, such as a persistent cough, were coming into work as they could not afford to live on the statutory sick pay (SSP) of £96 a week: “There are lots of people coughing around the call centre who haven’t been self-isolating because there is no guarantee of our jobs being there when we come back… Most of us can’t survive on SSP.”</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Callout callout-coronavirus-key-workers\">  <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div data-callout-tagname=&quot;callout-coronavirus-key-workers&quot;&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Callout&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;callout-coronavirus-key-workers&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>Concerns have also been raised by staff at the Teleperformance’s offices in Manchester and <a href=\"https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/politics/fearful-scots-call-centre-staff-21769687\">in Scotland</a>.

      "<p>If, like me, you have been confined to your home, glued to the news and nursing ever greater anxiety about the state of the world, you have probably become familiar with the sight of the World Health Organization’s director general, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, and his daily press briefings. Tedros, as he is known, is a calming presence in the midst of the crisis. Flanked by an international cast of scientists, he always seems confident that if we have hope, listen to the experts and pull together, we will get through this.</p> <p>Watching this reassuring spectacle, it is possible to imagine a world in which every nation respects the WHO’s authority, follows its advice and lets it coordinate the flow of information, resources and medical equipment across national boundaries to areas of greatest need.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/audio/2020/may/01/the-who-v-coronavirus-why-it-cant-handle-the-pandemic-podcast\">The WHO v coronavirus: why it can't handle the pandemic – podcast</a> </p> </aside>  <p>That is not the world we live in. “The W.H.O. really blew it. For some reason, funded largely by the United States, yet very China centric,” <a href=\"https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1247540701291638787\" title=\"\">tweeted</a> Donald Trump on 7 April, summing up just one of the many lines of criticism the WHO is currently facing. It is not just Trump – even some of the WHO’s supporters in government, academia and NGOs argue that since the start of the coronavirus crisis, it has caved in to nationalist bullies, praised draconian quarantine measures and failed to protect the liberal international order of which it is a linchpin. “You’ve got a situation where it looks like WHO doesn’t want to exercise its authority,” said David Fidler, a fellow in global health at the Council on Foreign Relations and a regular consultant to the WHO.</p> <p>Meanwhile, the WHO is desperately struggling to get its 194 member states to actually follow its guidance. The WHO’s leaders are “very frustrated,” said John MacKenzie, a virologist and adviser on the WHO’s <a href=\"https://www.who.int/ihr/procedures/novel-coronavirus-2019/ec-22012020-members/en/\" title=\"\">emergency committee</a>. “The messages come out loud and clear, and some disregard the warnings. The US largely did, the UK largely did.”</p> <p>On 11 March, the day Tedros declared the coronavirus a pandemic, he spoke darkly of “alarming levels of inaction” from many countries. Pressed by journalists to name them, Mike Ryan, the usually no-nonsense Irish trauma doctor who heads the WHO’s Covid-19 response, demurred. “You know who you are,” he said, adding that “we don’t criticise our member states in public”.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"f5d9b5d69d079af3d45a26a68aba8a4108aca8e6\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f5d9b5d69d079af3d45a26a68aba8a4108aca8e6/0_100_4554_2732/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Donald Trump at a coronavirus task force briefing at the White House on April 08, 2020 in Washington, DC.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Donald Trump at a coronavirus task force briefing at the White House.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>There is a simple reason for this. For all the responsibility vested in the WHO, it has little power. Unlike international bodies such as the World Trade Organization, the WHO, which is a specialised body of the UN, has no ability to bind or sanction its members. Its annual operating budget, about $2bn in 2019, is smaller than that of many university hospitals, and split among a dizzying array of public health and research projects. The WHO is less like a military general or elected leader with a strong mandate, and more like an underpaid sports coach wary of “losing the dressing room”, who can only get their way by charming, grovelling, cajoling and occasionally pleading with the players to do as they say.</p> <p>The WHO “has been drained of power and resources”, said Richard Horton, editor of the influential medical journal the Lancet. “Its coordinating authority and capacity are weak. Its ability to direct an international response to a life-threatening epidemic is non-existent.”</p> <p>At the same time, the international order on which the WHO relies is fraying, as aggressive nationalism becomes normalised around the world. “All the previous rules about global norms, public health and understanding of what’s expected in terms of an outbreak has crumbled,” said Lawrence Gostin, director of the WHO Collaborating Center on National and Global Health Law. “None of us know where this is leading.”</p> <h2><strong>* * *</strong></h2> <p>The WHO was born during the moment of hopeful internationalism that followed the chaos of the second world war. The idea of global collaboration in fighting disease was not new – in the 19th century, at periodic International Sanitary Conferences, countries had standardised quarantine procedures for cholera and yellow fever – but the WHO constitution, adopted in 1948, envisioned a far grander global mission, nothing less than “the attainment by all people of the highest possible levels of health”.</p> <p>One of the WHO’s favourite success stories is the role it played in eliminating smallpox, a disease that was still killing millions each year in the 50s, despite the existence of a vaccine. Although the WHO worked on immunisation research, its most vital role was organisational and diplomatic. In 1959, it convinced the Soviet Union to manufacture 25 million vaccine doses, which the WHO would distribute. Not to be left behind, the US donated millions of dollars to vaccination programmes, both directly and through the WHO. By the late 60s, every nation in the UN was sending a detailed weekly report to WHO headquarters on their number of smallpox cases and recent progress. And in 1979, WHO declared smallpox eradicated, a first in world history. The WHO didn’t provide the most money, immunise the most people, or invent key technologies such as the <a href=\"https://www.globalhealthnow.org/object/bifurcated-needle\" title=\"\">bifurcated needle</a>, but it is hard to imagine smallpox having been defeated without it.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"4044c399a9a92c0ce5d57746c8e2d81421beb2e4\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4044c399a9a92c0ce5d57746c8e2d81421beb2e4/0_0_4252_2835/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Posters of WHO chief Tedros Adhanom in Sao Paulo, Brazil last week.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Posters of WHO chief Tedros Adhanom in Sao Paulo, Brazil last week.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Fernando Bizerra Jr/EPA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>If the story of smallpox eradication shows the WHO acting as something like an international ministry of public health, it doesn’t explain its current position as an emergency service, surveying the world for disease outbreaks and springing into action to contain them. That is a more recent addition to its portfolio, which came after a period, in the 80s and 90s, when the WHO seemed to be losing its earlier dynamism. The diseases it was partly created to address – smallpox, yellow fever and the plague – had either been eradicated or were in decline, and it was slow to identify new threats such as HIV/Aids. Under the leadership of Dr Hiroshi Nakajima, from 1988 to 1998, the organisation stagnated, and some member states complained about poor management and alleged petty corruption.</p> <p>Two things happened at the turn of the century that would shape the WHO we now see tackling the Covid-19 crisis. In 1998, the fiery former prime minister of Norway, Dr Gro Harlem Brundtland, was elected director general. And in 2002, a farmer in China’s Guangdong province became sick with a deadly, never-before-seen respiratory disease that quickly spread among the hospital staff who had treated him, and went on to become the first pandemic of the newly globalised 21st century: one that arose suddenly, had no treatment or cure, and spread with the speed and reach of international business.</p> <h2><strong>* * *</strong></h2> <p>Given the WHO’s sprawling structure, vague mandate and reliance on diplomacy, its director general holds immense power to shape it. Even before she took on the role, Brundtland was comfortable on the world stage. “I was already a political leader, and I was used to this kind of authority,” she told me. Like her friend Kofi Annan, the charismatic UN leader, Brundtland believed that international bodies should be prepared to lead when necessary, rather than being bossed around by powerful nations. “If the job is to direct and coordinate global health, it’s not a question of what one or several governments ask you to do,” she said. “We are working for humanity.”</p> <p>Brundtland pushed the WHO to use its local contacts, diplomatic channels and the emerging internet to locate potential outbreaks, all of which made the organisation less reliant on national governments for information. Within just a few years, this strategy proved its worth. In November 2002, when the Chinese government became aware of the first cases of a novel respiratory disease, later named Sars, it failed to alert the WHO. But, as part of Brundtland’s new approach, WHO staff were monitoring Chinese medical message boards and news media anyway, and were aware of what was then thought to be an atypical pneumonia outbreak. Adding to their suspicions, on 10 February 2003, David Heymann, who was then executive director of the WHO’s communicable diseases cluster, received an email from the son of a former WHO staff member in China warning of a “strange contagious disease” that had already killed 100 people, but which was “not allowed to be made known to the public”. The WHO took the information it had to China, which made its first official report to the WHO the next day.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"fc41769b862cdfb9d6ccd578b4bfef561615bef5\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/fc41769b862cdfb9d6ccd578b4bfef561615bef5/0_0_2000_1386/1000.jpg\" alt=\"WHO director-general Gro Harlem Brundtland (centre) gives polio immunisation to a young boy in New Delhi in January 2000.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"693\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">WHO director-general Gro Harlem Brundtland (centre) gives polio immunisation to a young boy in New Delhi in January 2000.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: John Mcconnico/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Although the WHO had no formal powers to monitor and censure its members, Brundtland wasn’t shy about doing so anyway. In the ensuing months she would accuse China of withholding information, claiming that the outbreak might have been contained “if the WHO had been able to help at an earlier stage” and exhorting the Chinese to “let us come in as quickly as possible!” With remarkable speed, China fell in line and shared its data with the WHO. “After her statements to China, no other countries hesitated,” said Heymann.</p> <p>In March 2003, as the disease spread – reaching Hong Kong, Vietnam and then Canada – for the first time in its history, the WHO issued <a href=\"https://www.who.int/mediacentre/news/releases/2003/pr23/en/\" title=\"\">advice against travelling</a> to affected areas. (Before then, the decision to advise on travel had always been left up to member states.) Despite having no formal powers to ground planes, the measures worked. “Passengers and flights dropped dramatically as soon as we issued the recommendations,” said Heymann.</p> <p>Brundtland’s approach was not always popular, and some bridled under this new upstart WHO. “It wasn’t just China,” Brundtland told me. “The mayor of Toronto [Mel Lastman] flew to Geneva to tell us take down the travel recommendation – while at the same time he was not containing the outbreak. He had people with Sars riding around the subway, no contact tracing, no following up. He couldn’t accept we were telling him what to do!”</p> <p>The WHO’s response to Sars was considered a huge success. Fewer than 1,000 people worldwide died of the disease, despite it reaching a total of 26 countries. The pandemic was defeated not with vaccines or medicines, but with NPIs, or “non-pharmaceutical interventions” in WHO parlance: travel warnings, tracking, testing and isolating cases, and a huge information-gathering operation across multiple countries, all made possible by the WHO’s willingness to wield authority that it had, in a sense, created simply by speaking it into existence. “Brundtland did things the WHO had no authority doing. She just did them,” said Fidler. “She sort of used Sars as a way to test drive some very radical changes.”</p> <p>“After Sars, the WHO’s position was essentially: that was great, let’s formalise it,” said Clare Wenham, a professor of global health policy at LSE. In 2005, the WHO drew up a new version of the <a href=\"https://www.who.int/ihr/about/en/\" title=\"\">International Health Regulations (IHR)</a>, the central legal document that all member states are bound by. According to Fidler, the updated IHR, which is in force to this day, is a radical document. It asks its members to prepare for public health threats according to standards set by the WHO, and to report any outbreaks and all subsequent developments. It also allows the WHO to declare a public health emergency of international concern (or PHEIC, pronounced, incredibly, “fake”), using its own information, over the objection of any single country. During an emergency, countries are expected to take the lead from the WHO’s guidelines and report any deviations to the organisation. All of these requirements, bar the reporting of outbreaks, were new.</p> <p>But the document stopped short of giving the WHO real power if states refuse to comply. “The WHO isn’t Nato, it’s not the security council,” said Gian Luca Burci, who was the WHO’s legal counsel until 2018. The US, fixated on bioterrorism after 9/11, supported giving the organisation some extended powers, but was opposed by Brazil, Russia, India and China, which were wary of US influence. There was a general reluctance to hand an international organisation any more power. “WHO members were happy with the actions that were taken during Sars, but there was definitely a sense afterward of ‘What if that was us in China’s spot?’,” explained Catherine Worsnop, a professor at the University of Maryland School of Public Policy. In short: thanks for stopping the pandemic, but we don’t want to be told what to do.</p> <h2><strong>* * *</strong></h2> <p>If the WHO has seemed at times weak or tentative – very un-Brundtland-like – in its handling of the coronavirus crisis, it is partly because of its bruising experiences during the past decade. From 2009 onwards, the WHO faced condemnation from the press and the international community for its handling of successive crises, all during a decade when the financial and diplomatic order that sustained it began to break down.</p> <p>First, there was the outbreak of H1N1, or “swine flu”. The novel influenza virus was discovered in Mexico in March 2009, and by June, when the WHO declared a pandemic, there were more than 28,000 cases in 74 countries. Over the next year, the WHO coordinated the global response – less aggressively than during Sars – and on 10 August 2010, it declared the pandemic over. Almost immediately, the WHO’s approach came under scrutiny. The death toll – 18,500 confirmed deaths worldwide – was far lower than initially expected, particularly given the disease reached more than 200 countries. “Suddenly you have people saying: ‘Wait a minute, you really cried wolf on this,’” says Wenham. The media and several prominent European politicians demanded inquiries as to whether the WHO had mistakenly rung the alarm, and “cost huge amounts of money and frightened people unnecessarily”, as Paul Flynn, the former Labour MP who chaired one of the inquiries, told the Times in 2010.</p> <p>To this day, opinions are split as to whether H1N1 was a crisis headed off, or a false alarm. “The WHO is always at risk of being criticised as doing too much or too little,” said Keiji Fukuda, the former WHO assistant director general who led the H1N1 response. Most of the former WHO staff and academics I spoke with agreed, proposing some version of the following as an iron law of public health: act slowly and you will be criticised for failing to stop preventable deaths; act aggressively and stop an outbreak before it becomes serious, and you will be accused of having overreacted. (After all, in the latter case, nothing too bad happened, so what was the big deal in the first place?)</p> <p>Fidler, who largely approves of WHO’s quick action during H1N1, believes that the backlash led the WHO, which was then under the command of director general Margaret Chan, to become too tentative about calling for action in the future. This was a period when the fallout from the 2008 financial crisis was also starting to take its toll on its budget. “There was a big funding shortfall,” said Andrew Cassels, director of strategy at the WHO between 2008 and 2013. “Cuts made to the emergency response programmes, personnel cuts.” The funding gap stood at nearly $300m in 2012. Entire offices were shut, including a team of social scientists working on pandemic response.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"29cfebe6451704d592d057ee78cfddfd9ae9f240\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/29cfebe6451704d592d057ee78cfddfd9ae9f240/0_0_3000_1800/1000.jpg\" alt=\"WHO staff training nurses to use protective gear in Freetown, Sierra Leone during the 2014 ebola outbreak.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">WHO staff training nurses to use protective gear in Freetown, Sierra Leone during the 2014 ebola outbreak.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Michael Duff/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>When the Ebola outbreak struck west Africa in 2014, the combination of the WHO’s greater caution and reduced budget resulted in disaster. In contrast to the previous pandemic, this time the WHO was slow to act, and was widely perceived to have lost control of the situation. In the end, the US and several other nations <a href=\"https://www.lshtm.ac.uk/newsevents/news/2015/foreign_military_response_crucial_to_ebola.html\" title=\"\">deployed</a> more than 5,000 military personnel at the request of the affected countries, and an ad-hoc UN committee was created to take over responsibilities from the WHO. The outbreak eventually killed 11,310 people, the vast majority in just three countries – Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone – paralysing their health systems for months, and causing panic across the world. Prominent scientists <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/nov/22/experts-criticise-world-health-organisation-who-delay-ebola-outbreak\" title=\"\">judged</a> the WHO’s response an “egregious failure”.</p> <p>Much of the blame fell on Chan herself. She appeared shell-shocked, stressing to the press that the WHO was a technical advisory body, and that it was national governments that had ultimate responsibility for their citizens’ health. “She wanted the WHO to be an apolitical agency – more like technical support. There was a hesitancy there to push the full powers of the WHO,” said Sara Davies, a professor of global health at Griffith University in Australia.</p> <p>The bold, proactive culture established after Sars had seemingly faded. Fidler believes that by delaying calling Ebola an emergency, and thus failing to organise an international response at a crucial moment, the WHO’s leadership had shown they “no longer had any faith in their authority”.</p> <h2><strong>* * *</strong></h2> <p>Today, under Tedros, the WHO finds itself in uncharted territory. Not only is it facing by far the biggest pandemic in its history, it is also having to defend itself from the nations on which it most depends. “In my 25-plus years of working on global health issues, I cannot recall the leader of a prominent developed country threatening to punish WHO in the manner President Trump did,” said Fidler, referring to the recent press conference in which Trump suggested putting “a very powerful hold” on US contributions to the WHO. In the same press conference, Trump accused the WHO of concealing information, being too slow to react to the virus, and, above all, showing favouritism towards China.</p> <p>Since the crisis began, Tedros has been repeatedly accused of being soft on China. Senator Marco Rubio recently <a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/politics/bolton-joins-calls-for-who-directors-resignation-accomplice-to-chinas-massive-coverup\" title=\"\">told</a> Fox News that the Chinese government had “used the WHO to mislead the world”, and claimed that the WHO “is either complicit or dangerously incompetent”. The US senator Rick Scott put it more bluntly, accusing the WHO of “helping Communist China cover up a global pandemic”. (Tedros, meanwhile, has warned of the dangers of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global/video/2020/apr/09/politicising-covid-19-like-playing-with-fire-who-director-general-says-after-trump-attack-video\">politicising the virus</a>.)</p> <p>Until very recently, the WHO was seen as a relatively neutral arena for China to extend its power. “China likes to find ways within the global system to give it a leading and benevolent image. The WHO was an uncontroversial place to do it,” said Rana Mitter, the director of the University of Oxford China Centre. No longer. The extent of the initial coverup is still unclear, but there is no question that at least at the local level, Chinese officials knew about the outbreak of a novel disease for weeks before it was reported to the WHO. During that time, Chinese doctors were prevented from speaking out.</p> <p>John MacKenzie, the WHO’s emergency committee adviser, told me that the organisation was “a little misled” about the Wuhan outbreak. He says that by the time the government alerted the WHO on 31 December, scientists in China had already determined via genome sequencing that the outbreak was caused by coronavirus. Yet the government didn’t confirm that until 7 January and the full genome sequence was not officially shared until 12 January. “That’s very slow,” MacKenzie told me. “For at least two weeks, we could have been making far more kits and so on for testing.” MacKenzie added that the number of cases officially declared by the Chinese in the first week – 59 in the week ending 5 January – was “nowhere near as many cases as you’d expect”. (The statistics released by the Chinese government continue to be questioned, with some <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/03/world/asia/coronavirus-china-grief-deaths.html?auth=login-email&amp;login=email\" title=\"\">reports</a> suggesting they may have seriously understated the number of coronavirus deaths.)</p> <p>Despite mounting frustrations – in mid-January, China also refused the WHO’s request to send a team of scientific observers to Hubei province, the centre of the outbreak – Tedros has never come close to doing what Brundtland did and calling China out. Instead, on 28 January, he had a closed-door meeting with Xi Jinping in Beijing, and two days later, he praised Chinese efforts to contain the disease, declaring that China is “setting a new standard for outbreak control”. That same day, 30 January, the WHO declared a Pheic, and began issuing prescriptions to countries around the world. On 8 February, China finally allowed WHO observers into the country. For Tedros’s supporters, this was vindication of his strategy of keeping China onside. For his critics, it was too little, too late.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"10a09ac53b686e3d6a7da5a1660151fdfce8847e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/10a09ac53b686e3d6a7da5a1660151fdfce8847e/0_177_3996_2398/1000.jpg\" alt=\"WHO director-general Adhanom Ghebreyesus with Chinese President Xi Jinping in Beijing on 28 January 2020.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">WHO director-general Adhanom Ghebreyesus with Chinese President Xi Jinping in Beijing on 28 January 2020.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Naohiko Hatta/AFP via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Elected as WHO director general in July 2017, Tedros was supported by a bloc of African and Asian countries, including China, which has considerable influence with those members. (Tedros is himself from Ethiopia, where he served as health minister and then foreign minister between 2005 and 2016.) It was a “really nasty” election, said Davies, in which the powers that have traditionally shaped the WHO, such as the US, UK and Canada, lent their support to one of Tedros’s rivals, the British doctor David Nabarro. During the campaign, Tedros was criticised for having served in a repressive government with a poor human rights record, and one of Nabarro’s backers even <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/may/23/who-elects-first-ever-african-director-general-after-tense-vote-tedros-adhanom-ghebreyesus\" title=\"\">accused</a> Tedros of covering up a cholera epidemic during his time as health minister. (Tedros <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/13/health/candidate-who-director-general-ethiopia-cholera-outbreaks.html\" title=\"\">denied the</a> claim, describing it as a “last-minute smear campaign”, while Nabarro told the New York Times that he had never authorised his team to make this accusation against Tedros.) In response, Tedros’s supporters mounted “a collective pushback”, said Davies, against the UK and its allies, eventually winning out. Tedros became the first director general from a so-called developing country since the Brazilian Dr Marcolino Gomes Candau in 1953.</p> <p>While his background is in politics, Tedros is not forthright or confrontational like Brundtland. In Ethiopia, his political party, the Tigray People’s Liberation Front (TPLF) was mostly comprised of ex-revolutionaries, men that “seemed carved out of a rock”, said Fantu Cheru, a professor at American University and former advisor to the Ethiopian government. Tedros was different – jovial and accessible, said Cheru, and able to make personal connections easily. “He is not very ideological, he believes he can work with anyone,” said Mehari Taddele Maru, a professor at the European University Institute in Florence, Italy. Cheru also sees Tedros as a pragmatist. “He’s not in the Chinese pocket. The Americans in particular wanted to destroy his image. Tedros knows how this game works. You need to have more allies than enemies, and those allies may not have a good track record.”</p> <p>“I don’t think Tedros did anything previous director generals would not have done,” said Anthony Costello, the director of the UCL Institute for Global Health. “He needed a good relationship with China in order to get in.” Even Lawrence Gostin, who has been a prominent critic of Tedros in the past, told me that “his high praise for China is understandable. He is seeking to coax China into cooperation.” He went on to note, though, that this strategy “does risk the credibility of WHO as an objective agency.”</p> <p>If the WHO thought it could sacrifice a bit of its credibility – overlooking China’s obvious blunders in December and January in exchange for its compliance in February – and move on, it was mistaken. The argument over China’s influence has been raging for weeks, not least since the government of Taiwan <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-coronavirus-taiwan/taiwan-says-who-ignored-its-coronavirus-questions-at-start-of-outbreak-idUSKBN21B160\" title=\"\">claimed</a> that the WHO had ignored its own early reports of human-to-human transmission of coronavirus as part of a larger history of appeasing China – which has blocked Taiwan from joining the WHO (and the UN) for decades.</p> <p>Now that Trump, scrambling for an answer to explain why the US now has <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/08/coronavirus-world-map-which-countries-have-most-cases-deaths-covid-19\" title=\"\">more cases</a> of coronavirus than any other nation, has alighted upon the WHO and China as his preferred scapegoats, these questions will not go away. “I don’t think we will see the US government cut off funding,” said Fidler. “But what’s happened with this pandemic – with the WHO caught between the US/China rivalry – is not a good omen for the WHO going forward.”</p> <h2><strong>* * *</strong></h2> <p>While the focus has been on what happened between China and the WHO in January, in epidemiological terms the crisis has moved on. Covid-19 has spread fastest and furthest in the US and Europe, through the very rich nations that largely fund and staff the WHO. Before the outbreak, the WHO struggled to get these same nations to prepare for future pandemics. Now the pandemic is here, and they are at the centre of the crisis, the WHO has been unable to keep them following its advice.</p> <p>Richard Horton of the Lancet said that after the WHO declared a public health emergency, “countries, especially western countries, didn’t listen. Or didn’t seek to understand what was actually taking place in China.” On 5 February, the WHO <a href=\"https://www.who.int/news-room/detail/05-02-2020-us-675-million-needed-for-new-coronavirus-preparedness-and-response-global-plan\" title=\"\">asked for</a> $675m to fund its Coronavirus response through to April. Anthony Costello of UCL said that when he met with Tedros on 4 March, the WHO had received only $1.2m. (Tedros announced last week that the funding goal had finally been reached, around the time the number of worldwide cases passed 1 million.)</p> <p>Even the decision to declare a pandemic on 13 March – a largely rhetorical distinction, since calling a Pheic already requires WHO members to respond – was calculated to wake its member states up. In the UK the Premier League was still playing games, and the previous week the US had held primary election contests. “They declared a pandemic because countries weren’t taking the advice,” said Adam Kamradt-Scott, a professor of global health at the University of Sydney.</p> <p>The WHO stresses that the ideal response to the crisis is relatively simple. Individual states should limit public exposure, especially by tracking and tracing all known cases – a strategy that worked in South Korea and appears to be working in Germany. On an international level, states should share scientific information and resources. These are the mantras Tedros goes back to in his briefings: “Test test test” and “solidarity solidarity solidarity”.</p> <p>But countries have repeatedly ignored WHO advice. In the UK, the response has been erratic, lurching between the WHO’s norms and its own strategies, such as the now-discredited pursuit of “herd immunity”. The US didn’t recommend school closures or avoiding travel until 16 March. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/05/sweden-prepares-to-tighten-coronavirus-measures-as-death-toll-climbs\" title=\"\">In Sweden</a>, restaurants are still open.</p> <p>Many wealthy nations have not only pursued their own national strategies for public health, but have also withdrawn from the globalised world of diplomacy and trade that they themselves set up. Earlier this year, for instance, the NHS <a href=\"https://www.euronews.com/2020/03/06/coronavirus-french-protective-mask-manufacturer-scraps-nhs-order-to-keep-masks-in-france\" title=\"\">ordered</a> millions of masks from a French company named Valmy SAS. But in early March, the French government requisitioned all masks produced within the country, so the masks never reached Britain. This week, Germany <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/03/mask-wars-coronavirus-outbidding-demand\" title=\"\">accused the US</a> of seizing a shipment of masks bound for Berlin from a port in Thailand; while Germany previously <a href=\"https://www.rheinische-anzeigenblaetter.de/region/bonn/beim-us-konzern-3m-zoll-kontrollierte-schutzmasken-und-schutzkleidung-36443358\" title=\"\">sent inspectors</a> to the factory of an American company in Jüchen to ensure their medical masks weren’t being exported against government orders.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/27/inside-the-race-to-develop-a-coronavirus-vaccine-covid-19\">'It’s a razor’s edge we’re walking': inside the race to develop a coronavirus vaccine</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The WHO is battling against a breakdown in international cooperation that is far beyond its capacity to control. “Governments have retreated to national policies, and this problem predates this crisis,” said Clare Wenham, the health scholar. States have been turning away from international institutions for a long time. The WHO hasn’t driven globalisation in the same way as the WTO or IMF, but in a way it has administered it – quietly promising to take on the outbreaks that arise in an industrialised and interconnected world, and relying on the often unspoken norms of international collaboration that underlie it.</p> <p>Ironically, it is most needed now, at a time when faith in the other administrators and overseers of the global order are in decline – a trend that Covid-19 only seems to be accelerating. “As it’s gone on, you see the WHO becoming less important,” said Wenham. “No one is thinking about reducing the global numbers, only their own. The WHO is a global force, but people aren’t thinking globally.”</p> <p>• Follow the Long Read on Twitter at <a href=\"https://twitter.com/gdnlongread\" title=\"\">@gdnlongread</a>, and sign up to the long read weekly email <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/info/ng-interactive/2017/may/05/sign-up-for-the-long-read-email\" title=\"\">here</a>.</p>\n",
      "<p>The head of the British Medical Association has called on the government to urgently investigate if and why black, Asian and minority ethnic people are more vulnerable to Covid-19, after <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/18/not-ready-to-go-tributes-paid-to-uk-first-named-victims-of-coronavirus\">the first 10 doctors in the UK named as having died from the virus were all BAME</a>.</p> \n",
      "<p>Those doctors have ancestry in regions including Asia, the Middle East and Africa. Even allowing for the overrepresentation of BAME staff in the NHS – <a href=\"https://www.ethnicity-facts-figures.service.gov.uk/workforce-and-business/workforce-diversity/nhs-workforce/latest\">they comprise 44% of medical staff</a> compared with 14% of the population of England and Wales – the fact that they were all from ethnic minorities was “extremely disturbing and worrying”, the BMA chair said.</p> \n",
      "<p>“At face value, it seems hard to see how this can be random – to have the first 10 doctors of all being of BAME background,” Dr Chaand Nagpaul said. “Not only that, we also know that in terms of the BAME population, they make up about a third of those in intensive care. There’s a disproportionate percentage of BAME people getting ill.</p> \n",
      "<p>“We have heard the virus does not discriminate between individuals but there’s no doubt there appears to be a manifest disproportionate severity of infection in BAME people and doctors. This has to be addressed – the government must act now.”</p> \n",
      "<p>As well as the 10 doctors, three out of six nurses named as having died have also been BAME as was a hospital pharmacist and at least one healthcare assistant. The overall death figures in the UK have not been broken down by ethnicity but early research published this week showed that<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/07/bame-groups-hit-harder-covid-19-than-white-people-uk\"> 35% of almost 2,000 patients in intensive care units were non-white</a>.</p> \n",

      "<h2>Nagpaul said BAME health professionals were understandably concerned about the deaths of their colleagues and what it might mean for them. The BMA chair said it might be too early to get firm answers but that it needed to be investigated.</h2> \n",
      "<p>Among the factors he speculated could be contributing was whether BAME doctors felt less able to complain about inadequate personal protective equipment (PPE) – <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/06/nhs-doctors-lacking-ppe-bullied-into-treating-covid-19-patients\">a recurring complaint among healthcare workers during the crisis</a> – thereby putting themselves in danger.</p> \n",
      "<p>“<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jun/02/black-nhs-staff-more-likely-bullied-than-white-colleagues\">BAME doctors often feel bullied and harassed at higher levels</a> compared to their white counterparts,” he said. “They are twice as likely not to raise concerns because of fears of recrimination.”</p> \n",
      "<p>He said the death of BAME doctors was particularly upsetting because of “the vast majority – I think only one was born here – who have come from overseas and have given their lives to the NHS, to save the lives of others”.</p> \n",
      "<p>Among the wider BAME population, he suggested the fact that many were in key worker roles, combined with their living arrangements, could be contributing to their disproportionate presence in intensive care units.</p> \n",
      "<p>“You’ve got a high proportion of BAME people not able to stay at home, serving the nation, putting themselves at risk,” he said. “If you add that to overcrowded and multigenerational occupancies, the infections can be brought back home and spread to other members of the family.”</p> \n",
      "<p>Nagpaul questioned whether enough was being done in terms of translating information leaflets about Covid-19 and physical distancing for people for whom English is a second language, suggesting mosques and temples could be used by the government to help relay the message. He said difficulties speaking English could lead to problems accessing NHS 111 either online or on the phone.</p> \n",
      "<p>Nagpaul also highlighted the higher prevalence of diabetes, heart disease and kidney disease among BAME communities than in the white population, adding: “Previous inequalities will be greater at a time of crisis. This [coronavirus] may be bringing into focus historic inequalities facing BAME communities.”</p> \n",
      "<figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Callout callout-coronavirus\"> <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"<html><head></head><body><div data-callout-tagname=&quot;callout-coronavirus&quot;> <h2>Callout</h2> <p>callout-coronavirus</p> </div></body></html>\"></iframe> \n",
      "</figure> \n",
      "<p>He said the best advice for BAME doctors to protect themselves against Covid-19 until more was known about the virus was the same as for any of their colleagues: ensure they are wearing appropriate PPE. He urged them not to risk their life if it was not forthcoming.</p> \n",
      "<p>“We need to safeguard our BAME population and the BAME medical officers,” he said “These are workers who are <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2019/jun/25/nhs-treating-minority-ethnic-doctors-as-outsiders\">already experiencing significant hardships working for the NHS</a>. They are serving the nation at a time of unprecedented crisis. The government must take steps to address this.”</p> \n",
      "<p>The Department of Health and Social Care said it was working hard to protect all communities, adding that translations of the public information leaflet, posted to all 30 million households in the UK, were <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/coronavirus-covid-19-information-leaflet\">available on its website</a>.</p>\n"

       "   'body': '<p>Welcome to our weekly roundup of developments in the coronavirus pandemic that continues to spread around the world. As the outbreak <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/ng-interactive/2020/apr/08/coronavirus-100-days-that-changed-the-world\">passed the 100-day mark</a> and many countries extended their lockdowns, others moved to relax restrictions wary that cases may take off again.</p> \\n<h2><strong>Scientists shed light on </strong><strong>immune response to coronavirus</strong></h2> \\n<p>On Monday, a team at Fudan University in Shanghai <a href=\"https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.30.20047365v1\">reported the first detailed analysis</a> of the immune response in patients with coronavirus. Tests on the blood of 175 patients who had been discharged from hospitals in Shanghai revealed that neutralising antibodies – those that can wipe out the virus – usually arose 10 to 15 days after the onset of illness and targeted three different parts of the “spike” protein on the virus’s surface.</p> \\n<p>While older patients produced the highest levels of neutralising antibodies, many patients had low levels and 10 did not appear to generate them at all. If the findings hold up – the study has yet to be reviewed and published – they have widespread implications. The more robust immune response from older people suggests their blood plasma may work best in trials that are assessing whether <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2020/mar/29/coronavirus-survivors-blood-plasma-could-be-used-to-fight-infection\">convalescent plasma</a> infusions can help seriously ill patients overcome the virus. But the findings may frustrate <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2020/apr/08/health-minister-defends-uk-coronavirus-testing-approach-chris-whitty-germany-covid-19\">efforts to manufacture an accurate antibody test</a> for the virus if many people have low or even non-existent levels of neutralising antibodies. This week it emerged that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/09/uk-government-urged-to-abandon-poor-finger-prick-antibody-tests-coronavirus\">none of the antibody tests</a> purchased by the UK government were good enough to roll out.</p> \\n<p>The work also has implications for<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/30/immunity-passports-could-speed-up-return-to-work-after-covid-19\"> “immunity passports”</a>, which could allow people to return to normal life if blood tests showed they had developed immunity to the virus. Nearly 6% of the recovered patients had no neutralising antibodies, suggesting that other parts of the immune system had cleared the infection, without producing long-term immunity.</p> \\n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"ba9786c6-c779-4063-8bf9-1d3009eb7c70\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \\n  <div>\\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/3qV7R2iYVXg?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\\n  </div>\\n </gu-atom> \\n</figure> \\n<h2><strong>Not everyone agrees on wearing face masks</strong></h2> \\n<p>Whether or not to don a face mask in public became a matter of debate and confusion. After a <a href=\"https://www.who.int/publications-detail/advice-on-the-use-of-masks-in-the-community-during-home-care-and-in-healthcare-settings-in-the-context-of-the-novel-coronavirus-(2019-ncov)-outbreak\">review of new evidence</a>, the World Health Organization maintained its view on Monday that while people who have cough, fever and difficulty breathing should wear a mask and seek medical help, there was no need for healthy people to wear face masks in public. The organisation conceded that people without symptoms can spread the virus, but only recommended healthy people wear face masks when they were caring for a coronavirus patient and in the same room. The masks can help prevent infections by catching large virus-laden droplets that are expelled from patients when they cough and sneeze, but <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/apr/03/face-masks-coronavirus-scientists-evidence-covid-19-public\">David Heymann</a>, who chairs the WHO’s risk committee, said face masks can give people a false sense of security if they do not combine an effective one with eye protection and adopt strict hand hygiene measures.</p> \\n<p>The UK has a similar stance to the WHO and does not recommend healthy people wear masks in public. But the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) not only <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/prevent-getting-sick/cloth-face-cover.html\">advises people to wear face masks</a> outside, but offers guidance on how to make “cloth face coverings” too. On Tuesday, US government scientists argued the case for face coverings after <a href=\"https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.02.20051177v1\">preliminary research</a> showed people spray out thousands of tiny saliva droplets when they speak simple sentences such as “stay healthy”. Adriaan Bax at the US National Institutes of Health, who led the work, found a damp homemade cloth face mask “dramatically reduced droplet excretion”.</p> \\n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"a81dbd86-f7c7-4b2d-affa-9a6aff9b9b5f\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \\n  <div>\\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/4xFY3aPF7E4?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\\n  </div>\\n </gu-atom> \\n</figure> \\n<h2><strong>Some countries look towards easing </strong><strong>lockdowns</strong></h2> \\n<p>Following in the footsteps of China, a number of countries announced plans to relax restrictions they had put in place to stop the spread of the virus. On Wednesday, China, lifted its 11-week lockdown in Wuhan where the outbreak began. The following day, the Czech Republic allowed bicycle shops and DIY, hobby and hardware stores to reopen. After the Easter break, Austria will let small shops, DIY stores and garden centres return to business, while Denmark plans to reopen kindergartens and primary schools. But with the virus still present and large numbers of people still vulnerable to infection, health officials are watching closely for cases to surge again. As Denmark’s prime minister, Metter Frederiksen, commented: “It’s like walking a tightrope.”</p> \\n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \\n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/gallery/2020/apr/08/wuhan-ends-coronavirus-lockdown-in-pictures\">Wuhan ends coronavirus lockdown – in pictures</a> </p> \\n</aside> \\n<p>The British prime minister, Boris Johnson, was admitted to intensive care for several days but <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global/2020/apr/09/boris-johnson-moved-from-intensive-care-but-stays-in-hospital\">returned to a ward on Thursday</a> after he improved without needing mechanical ventilation. In his absence, the foreign secretary, Dominic Raab, scotched hopes for an early end to the UK lockdown and refused to be drawn on exit strategies until the country was beyond the peak of the epidemic. But discussions are underway in Whitehall where options range from a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2020/apr/09/lifting-lockdown-uk-options-graded-return-normality\">“youth first”</a> policy that would allow young workers to return to their jobs, to a staggered <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/apr/09/uk-lockdown-could-end-with-sector-by-sector-plan-for-firms\">sector-by-sector approach</a>.

President Trump imposed restrictions on travellers from China at the end of January but only blocked travel from most European countries in mid-March. Separate teams at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai in New York City and New York University reached similar conclusions after studying the genetic code of viruses obtained from patients in the region. The scientists traced the origins of the outbreak by analysing patterns of mutations that accumulate in viruses as they spread. “The majority is clearly European,” Harm van Bakel, a geneticist from one of the teams, told the <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/08/science/new-york-coronavirus-cases-europe-genomes.html\">New York Times</a>. The same approach was used last month to trace the coronavirus back to <a href=\"https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.30.015008v1\">infected bats</a>.</p> \\n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \\n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/ng-interactive/2020/apr/09/how-coronavirus-spread-across-the-globe-visualised\">How coronavirus spread across the globe - visualised</a> </p> \\n</aside> \\n<h2><strong>And finally…</strong></h2> \\n<p>As streets emptied out and factories closed their doors, scientists at the British Geological Survey noticed their sensitive earthquake-detecting seismometers had stopped twitching as much. Closer inspection of the charts revealed that the lockdown has changed how the Earth moves beneath our feet: there are fewer vibrations from human noise passing through the planet.</p> \\n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \\n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/09/climate-crisis-amid-coronavirus-lockdown-nature-bounces-back-but-for-how-long\">Climate crisis: in coronavirus lockdown, nature bounces back – but for how long?</a> </p> \\n</aside> \\n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2020/apr/06/lockdown-has-cut-britains-vibrations-seismologists-find\">fall in background noise</a>, particularly around urban seismometers, has left scientists wondering if they might detect earthquakes that are smaller than normal, or at distances that are normally beyond their range. With lockdowns easing around the world, they do not have long to look. As Brian Baptie at the BGS conceded: “We may not get anything in the short term.”</p>',\n",

       "   'body': '<p>As the daughter of an air force officer and a nurse, I am fascinated by defence systems. There is none more impressive than the human immune system, equipped as it is with a rich arsenal to defend against different types of pathogen. Viruses have evolved to trick, bypass and evade these defences. Our immune systems have, in turn, learned to recognise and deter these virus stealth tactics. In Covid-19, the enemy is a tiny piece of genetic material wearing a lipid coat and a protein crown.</p> <p>So how is our immune system able to defend against viral infections, and how does this apply to Covid-19? The virus that causes Covid-19 is called severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (Sars-Cov-2), and was first detected in humans around five months ago. It is a coronavirus. “Corona”, in Latin, means crown. The virus is adorned with an outer layer of protein covered in spikes, like a crown. These spikes help the virus attach itself to target cells. The research community is<strong> </strong>fast learning about immunity to Covid-19, and we are also applying our knowledge of similar respiratory viruses to predict what to expect in this infection.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Importantly, Covid-19 cannot gain entry to our homes or bodies by itself – we have to let it in</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Think of a virus as a robot; it cannot reproduce so it needs a factory of materials – proteins, lipids and nucleotides –<strong> </strong>to build copies of itself. The coat allows the virus to attach itself to the target cell’s membrane. The virus then fuses with the cell and releases a<strong> </strong>shopping list of instructions<strong> </strong>on how to build and assemble new viruses. This shopping list, the virus genome, is written in nucleotides (RNA). The first job of a virus that enters our bodies is to invade target cells so that it can comfortably remove its coat and deploy its RNA.</p> <p>Once inside, the virus commandeers the cell and borrows cellular machinery<strong> </strong>to build more viruses before immune cells detect the intruders and raise the alarm. Antibody proteins that are able to stick to the virus-spike proteins, and prevent attachment to the target cells, are called neutralising antibodies: generating them is often the goal of protective vaccination.</p> <p>Our infected cells make the ultimate sacrifice and invite their own destruction by displaying distress signals for<strong> </strong>T-cells, which swiftly detect and kill them. T-cells are cytotoxic – powerful serial killers that can recognise peptide fragments of virus displayed on the infected cell surface. When they do, they release a payload of toxic enzymes that kill the infected cell in a “kiss of death”. This strategic martyrdom is organised by the immune system to deprive the virus of its replication factories and can lead to the reduction of viral load in the patient. It takes several days for antiviral T-cells to expand and antibodies to be generated. Here’s the silver lining<strong>:</strong> memory cells ensure that if we encounter the same virus again, we can react immediately with pre-existing defences. Sars-Cov-2 is new to humanity so we have no protective immunological memory. Vaccines prepared using harmless parts of the virus can help us build protective memory.</p> <p>The virus’s enemy superpower is spreading. The virus achieves this through “shedding” from infected patients. Sars-Cov-2 is expert at hopping from person to person, and in some people, it achieves a stealthy existence with mild or no symptoms. Once many copies of the virus are made, it needs to jump to another host. It hitches a ride on droplets that can be coughed or sneezed to a distance of up to two metres. Droplets can survive on surfaces for several hours enabling pick<strong>-</strong>up by a new host, or they can be directly inhaled if another person is in close proximity. Studies are emerging into <a href=\"https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2020/03/should-pets-be-tested-coronavirus\">animal hosts</a> – so far the virus has been detected in a few ferrets, cats, tigers and dogs. No animal deaths have yet been reported, and we don’t know if animals can transmit back to humans.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/21/coronavirus-vaccine-scientist-what-needs-to-be-done-now-hanneke-schuitemaker\">Vaccine scientist: ‘Everything is so new in dealing with this coronavirus’</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The age differential in fatalities for Covid-19 suggests, with some exceptions, that a healthy immune system is usually able to control infection. Meanwhile, an ageing or weakened immune system may struggle to deploy a protective arsenal. Importantly, Sars-Cov-2 cannot gain entry to our homes or bodies by itself – we have to let it in. This is why official advice has centred around<strong> </strong>cleaning our hands and avoiding touching our faces.</p> <p>We know that a healthy immune system is usually able to eliminate infection in a couple of weeks. However, we have no understanding of the components of our immune arsenal that contribute to this feat: some vaccines work by creating potent neutralising antibodies; other vaccines generate powerful memory T-cells. Antiviral antibodies emerge as early as three to four days after virus detection, but are they protective against future reinfection? We believe that antibodies to other coronaviruses (Sars, Mers) last from one to three years. Because this is a new virus, we don’t yet know the answer to this question. Public Health England is <a href=\"https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/878121/coronavirus-covid-19-testing-strategy.pdf\">recruiting</a> 16,000 to 20,000 volunteers to monitor antibodies once a month for six to 12 months to confirm whether we can generate long-lasting antibody responses to Sars-Cov-2. Determining the quality of these antibodies will be important to understanding long-term protection.</p> <p>What is our most potent immune weapon against Covid-19? <a href=\"https://twitter.com/bertoletti_lab/status/1247015473683632129\">Cytotoxic T-cells</a> may play an important role. Immunologists and virologists are working together to discover the correlates of protection, to design vaccines that offer long-term defences against Covid-19. Years of investment in research means that we can use existing approaches to respond to this new threat, and early mobilisation of research funders, philanthropists and academics are diverting resources to bolster these efforts on an unprecedented scale. Experience has taught us that vaccines are able to eradicate infections from this planet (for instance, smallpox), and medicines against viruses that don’t embed their genetic material to our own (for example, hepatitis C) can also achieve this.</p> <p>Our secret weapon is research. Scientists are working hard on understanding Covid-19, and collaboration is key to this effort. But until a vaccine or treatment is available, we ought to work hard to protect ourselves and our families: isolate and prevent transmission by using physical distancing, face masks and sensible hygiene. If we all do our part, this little virus holding the world to ransom won’t stand a chance.</p> <p>• Zania Stamataki is a senior lecturer and researcher in viral immunology at the University of Birmingham</p>',\n",

Like all the best epigrams, it is deeply wise, even if it overgeneralises. I can’t think of many instances from my own life where it isn’t true. A breakdown, a miscarriage, a job lost – they all led to better things.</p> <p>The phrase reminds me of something Winston Churchill supposedly said on losing the 1945 election. His wife apparently told him that defeat may well have been a blessing in disguise. “Madame, if this is a blessing, it is indeed well disguised,” he replied.</p> <p>And yet a blessing it was. Britain got Attlee, the welfare state, the NHS. Churchill got a rest, and then his swansong six years later. The rest is history.</p> <p>And so to the present.

       "   'body': '<p>Call centre staff at the NHS’s 111 helpline are turning up to work with coronavirus symptoms owing to a lack of adequate sick pay, according to a whistleblower who has filed a complaint to MPs.</p> <p>Concerns about health and safety have been raised by call handlers at at least three call centres where thousands of people are employed by outsourcing firms to field calls to the 111 service.</p> <p>One employee, whose complaint has been published by a commons select committee, told the Guardian that colleagues felt ill-prepared for the mass volume of calls and “terrified” they would catch the virus due to “unsafe” working conditions.</p> <p>The call-handler, who works for the outsourcing firm Teleperformance, said communal equipment including coffee machines, exit buttons and door handles were cleaned only twice a day – which the company does not dispute – and that staff were given only “very, very basic” training on how to handle 111 calls about the coronavirus.</p> <p>The government has asked some of the UK’s biggest private call centre operators to massively scale up their NHS 111 capacity amid a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2020/apr/05/calls-nhs-111-soar-400-since-start-coronavirus-crisis-uk\">400% increase in calls</a> due to the outbreak. Scores of often inexperienced staff have been hired in huge numbers in only a few days, posing challenges for the employees and companies involved.</p> <p>The call handler, who asked not to be named for fear of losing his job, said: “Managers, floorwalkers and staff have all been thrown into this with very, very basic training and there are a lot of situations that we aren’t prepared for.”</p> <p>The agency worker said staff with potential Covid-19 symptoms, such as a persistent cough, were coming into work as they could not afford to live on the statutory sick pay (SSP) of £96 a week: “There are lots of people coughing around the call centre who haven’t been self-isolating because there is no guarantee of our jobs being there when we come back… Most of us can’t survive on SSP.”</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Callout callout-coronavirus-key-workers\">  <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div data-callout-tagname=&quot;callout-coronavirus-key-workers&quot;&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Callout&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;callout-coronavirus-key-workers&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>Concerns have also been raised by staff at the Teleperformance’s offices in Manchester and <a href=\"https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/politics/fearful-scots-call-centre-staff-21769687\">in Scotland</a>. The French company, which is one of the government’s biggest call centre operators, said more than half of its nearly 7,000 call handlers were working from home and that the health, safety and security of its staff “has always been our top priority”. It said it had ordered hundreds of thousands of masks for employees and that cleaning of communal areas had increased from once a week to twice daily.</p> <p>Gary Slade, the company’s UK chief executive, said it was “fully compliant” with the government’s sick pay guidelines and that anyone who displayed Covid-19 symptoms was being sent home to self-isolate. “This is not about making money [or] treating people badly – we’ve never been that way,” he added. “But this is definitely without doubt our number one priority: do what’s right for our people and that’s what we’re doing.</p> <p>“Are we perfect? Probably not. There’s always room for improvement. But we’re doing everything we can, working as hard and as fast as we can.”</p> <p>The Guardian found several outsourcing firms recruiting NHS 111 operators for as little as <a href=\"https://www.reed.co.uk/jobs/111-call-handler/40211636?source=details.similarjobs\">£9.09 an hour</a> – barely above the UK minimum wage – despite their role as the first point of contact for people who think they have the coronavirus. One outsourcing firm <a href=\"https://www.reed.co.uk/jobs/home/view/40183565\">said</a> in its job advertisement that no previous customer service experience was needed, adding: “Your personality is far more important than your previous experience.”</p> <p>Concerns have been raised by NHS 111 operators at another firm, Sitel. The Labour MP Luke Pollard said he had received complaints from “dozens” of staff employed at the firm’s call centre in Plymouth, which is handling 111 calls. Staff told him they were working “desk to desk”, in breach of the coronavirus physical distancing rules, and that workplaces were not being deep-cleaned, leaving many afraid to go to work for fear of catching the virus.</p> <p>The company, which is owned by one of the world’s richest families, is said to have instructed call handlers not to speak to the media about their concerns. Pollard said: “If you’re scared of going to work, that is as real as it can get and that needs to be addressed.”</p> <p>Sitel declined to answer a series of questions when contacted by the Guardian. A spokeswoman confirmed that the company was in dialogue with Pollard and that it was following the safety measures outlined on <a href=\"https://www.sitel.com/covid-19-updates/\">its website</a>.</p>',\n",

       "   'body': '<p>If, like me, you have been confined to your home, glued to the news and nursing ever greater anxiety about the state of the world, you have probably become familiar with the sight of the World Health Organization’s director general, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, and his daily press briefings. Tedros, as he is known, is a calming presence in the midst of the crisis. Flanked by an international cast of scientists, he always seems confident that if we have hope, listen to the experts and pull together, we will get through this.</p> <p>Watching this reassuring spectacle, it is possible to imagine a world in which every nation respects the WHO’s authority, follows its advice and lets it coordinate the flow of information, resources and medical equipment across national boundaries to areas of greatest need.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/audio/2020/may/01/the-who-v-coronavirus-why-it-cant-handle-the-pandemic-podcast\">The WHO v coronavirus: why it can\\'t handle the pandemic – podcast</a> </p> </aside>  <p>That is not the world we live in. “The W.H.O. really blew it. For some reason, funded largely by the United States, yet very China centric,” <a href=\"https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1247540701291638787\" title=\"\">tweeted</a> Donald Trump on 7 April, summing up just one of the many lines of criticism the WHO is currently facing. It is not just Trump – even some of the WHO’s supporters in government, academia and NGOs argue that since the start of the coronavirus crisis, it has caved in to nationalist bullies, praised draconian quarantine measures and failed to protect the liberal international order of which it is a linchpin. “You’ve got a situation where it looks like WHO doesn’t want to exercise its authority,” said David Fidler, a fellow in global health at the Council on Foreign Relations and a regular consultant to the WHO.</p> <p>Meanwhile, the WHO is desperately struggling to get its 194 member states to actually follow its guidance. The WHO’s leaders are “very frustrated,” said John MacKenzie, a virologist and adviser on the WHO’s <a href=\"https://www.who.int/ihr/procedures/novel-coronavirus-2019/ec-22012020-members/en/\" title=\"\">emergency committee</a>. “The messages come out loud and clear, and some disregard the warnings. The US largely did, the UK largely did.”</p> <p>On 11 March, the day Tedros declared the coronavirus a pandemic, he spoke darkly of “alarming levels of inaction” from many countries. Pressed by journalists to name them, Mike Ryan, the usually no-nonsense Irish trauma doctor who heads the WHO’s Covid-19 response, demurred. “You know who you are,” he said, adding that “we don’t criticise our member states in public”.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"f5d9b5d69d079af3d45a26a68aba8a4108aca8e6\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f5d9b5d69d079af3d45a26a68aba8a4108aca8e6/0_100_4554_2732/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Donald Trump at a coronavirus task force briefing at the White House on April 08, 2020 in Washington, DC.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Donald Trump at a coronavirus task force briefing at the White House.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>There is a simple reason for this. For all the responsibility vested in the WHO, it has little power. Unlike international bodies such as the World Trade Organization, the WHO, which is a specialised body of the UN, has no ability to bind or sanction its members. Its annual operating budget, about $2bn in 2019, is smaller than that of many university hospitals, and split among a dizzying array of public health and research projects. The WHO is less like a military general or elected leader with a strong mandate, and more like an underpaid sports coach wary of “losing the dressing room”, who can only get their way by charming, grovelling, cajoling and occasionally pleading with the players to do as they say.</p> <p>The WHO “has been drained of power and resources”, said Richard Horton, editor of the influential medical journal the Lancet. “Its coordinating authority and capacity are weak. Its ability to direct an international response to a life-threatening epidemic is non-existent.”</p> <p>At the same time, the international order on which the WHO relies is fraying, as aggressive nationalism becomes normalised around the world. “All the previous rules about global norms, public health and understanding of what’s expected in terms of an outbreak has crumbled,” said Lawrence Gostin, director of the WHO Collaborating Center on National and Global Health Law. “None of us know where this is leading.”</p> <h2><strong>* * *</strong></h2> <p>The WHO was born during the moment of hopeful internationalism that followed the chaos of the second world war. The idea of global collaboration in fighting disease was not new – in the 19th century, at periodic International Sanitary Conferences, countries had standardised quarantine procedures for cholera and yellow fever – but the WHO constitution, adopted in 1948, envisioned a far grander global mission, nothing less than “the attainment by all people of the highest possible levels of health”.</p> <p>One of the WHO’s favourite success stories is the role it played in eliminating smallpox, a disease that was still killing millions each year in the 50s, despite the existence of a vaccine. Although the WHO worked on immunisation research, its most vital role was organisational and diplomatic. In 1959, it convinced the Soviet Union to manufacture 25 million vaccine doses, which the WHO would distribute. Not to be left behind, the US donated millions of dollars to vaccination programmes, both directly and through the WHO. By the late 60s, every nation in the UN was sending a detailed weekly report to WHO headquarters on their number of smallpox cases and recent progress. And in 1979, WHO declared smallpox eradicated, a first in world history. The WHO didn’t provide the most money, immunise the most people, or invent key technologies such as the <a href=\"https://www.globalhealthnow.org/object/bifurcated-needle\" title=\"\">bifurcated needle</a>, but it is hard to imagine smallpox having been defeated without it.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"4044c399a9a92c0ce5d57746c8e2d81421beb2e4\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4044c399a9a92c0ce5d57746c8e2d81421beb2e4/0_0_4252_2835/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Posters of WHO chief Tedros Adhanom in Sao Paulo, Brazil last week.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Posters of WHO chief Tedros Adhanom in Sao Paulo, Brazil last week.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Fernando Bizerra Jr/EPA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>If the story of smallpox eradication shows the WHO acting as something like an international ministry of public health, it doesn’t explain its current position as an emergency service, surveying the world for disease outbreaks and springing into action to contain them. That is a more recent addition to its portfolio, which came after a period, in the 80s and 90s, when the WHO seemed to be losing its earlier dynamism. The diseases it was partly created to address – smallpox, yellow fever and the plague – had either been eradicated or were in decline, and it was slow to identify new threats such as HIV/Aids. Under the leadership of Dr Hiroshi Nakajima, from 1988 to 1998, the organisation stagnated, and some member states complained about poor management and alleged petty corruption.</p> <p>Two things happened at the turn of the century that would shape the WHO we now see tackling the Covid-19 crisis. In 1998, the fiery former prime minister of Norway, Dr Gro Harlem Brundtland, was elected director general. And in 2002, a farmer in China’s Guangdong province became sick with a deadly, never-before-seen respiratory disease that quickly spread among the hospital staff who had treated him, and went on to become the first pandemic of the newly globalised 21st century: one that arose suddenly, had no treatment or cure, and spread with the speed and reach of international business.</p> <h2><strong>* * *</strong></h2> <p>Given the WHO’s sprawling structure, vague mandate and reliance on diplomacy, its director general holds immense power to shape it. Even before she took on the role, Brundtland was comfortable on the world stage. “I was already a political leader, and I was used to this kind of authority,” she told me. Like her friend Kofi Annan, the charismatic UN leader, Brundtland believed that international bodies should be prepared to lead when necessary, rather than being bossed around by powerful nations. “If the job is to direct and coordinate global health, it’s not a question of what one or several governments ask you to do,” she said. “We are working for humanity.”</p> <p>Brundtland pushed the WHO to use its local contacts, diplomatic channels and the emerging internet to locate potential outbreaks, all of which made the organisation less reliant on national governments for information. Within just a few years, this strategy proved its worth. In November 2002, when the Chinese government became aware of the first cases of a novel respiratory disease, later named Sars, it failed to alert the WHO. But, as part of Brundtland’s new approach, WHO staff were monitoring Chinese medical message boards and news media anyway, and were aware of what was then thought to be an atypical pneumonia outbreak. Adding to their suspicions, on 10 February 2003, David Heymann, who was then executive director of the WHO’s communicable diseases cluster, received an email from the son of a former WHO staff member in China warning of a “strange contagious disease” that had already killed 100 people, but which was “not allowed to be made known to the public”. The WHO took the information it had to China, which made its first official report to the WHO the next day.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"fc41769b862cdfb9d6ccd578b4bfef561615bef5\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/fc41769b862cdfb9d6ccd578b4bfef561615bef5/0_0_2000_1386/1000.jpg\" alt=\"WHO director-general Gro Harlem Brundtland (centre) gives polio immunisation to a young boy in New Delhi in January 2000.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"693\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">WHO director-general Gro Harlem Brundtland (centre) gives polio immunisation to a young boy in New Delhi in January 2000.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: John Mcconnico/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Although the WHO had no formal powers to monitor and censure its members, Brundtland wasn’t shy about doing so anyway. In the ensuing months she would accuse China of withholding information, claiming that the outbreak might have been contained “if the WHO had been able to help at an earlier stage” and exhorting the Chinese to “let us come in as quickly as possible!” With remarkable speed, China fell in line and shared its data with the WHO. “After her statements to China, no other countries hesitated,” said Heymann.</p> <p>In March 2003, as the disease spread – reaching Hong Kong, Vietnam and then Canada – for the first time in its history, the WHO issued <a href=\"https://www.who.int/mediacentre/news/releases/2003/pr23/en/\" title=\"\">advice against travelling</a> to affected areas. (Before then, the decision to advise on travel had always been left up to member states.) Despite having no formal powers to ground planes, the measures worked. “Passengers and flights dropped dramatically as soon as we issued the recommendations,” said Heymann.</p> <p>Brundtland’s approach was not always popular, and some bridled under this new upstart WHO. “It wasn’t just China,” Brundtland told me. “The mayor of Toronto [Mel Lastman] flew to Geneva to tell us take down the travel recommendation – while at the same time he was not containing the outbreak. He had people with Sars riding around the subway, no contact tracing, no following up. He couldn’t accept we were telling him what to do!”</p> <p>The WHO’s response to Sars was considered a huge success. Fewer than 1,000 people worldwide died of the disease, despite it reaching a total of 26 countries. The pandemic was defeated not with vaccines or medicines, but with NPIs, or “non-pharmaceutical interventions” in WHO parlance: travel warnings, tracking, testing and isolating cases, and a huge information-gathering operation across multiple countries, all made possible by the WHO’s willingness to wield authority that it had, in a sense, created simply by speaking it into existence. “Brundtland did things the WHO had no authority doing. She just did them,” said Fidler. “She sort of used Sars as a way to test drive some very radical changes.”</p> <p>“After Sars, the WHO’s position was essentially: that was great, let’s formalise it,” said Clare Wenham, a professor of global health policy at LSE. In 2005, the WHO drew up a new version of the <a href=\"https://www.who.int/ihr/about/en/\" title=\"\">International Health Regulations (IHR)</a>, the central legal document that all member states are bound by. According to Fidler, the updated IHR, which is in force to this day, is a radical document. It asks its members to prepare for public health threats according to standards set by the WHO, and to report any outbreaks and all subsequent developments. It also allows the WHO to declare a public health emergency of international concern (or PHEIC, pronounced, incredibly, “fake”), using its own information, over the objection of any single country. During an emergency, countries are expected to take the lead from the WHO’s guidelines and report any deviations to the organisation. All of these requirements, bar the reporting of outbreaks, were new.</p> <p>But the document stopped short of giving the WHO real power if states refuse to comply. “The WHO isn’t Nato, it’s not the security council,” said Gian Luca Burci, who was the WHO’s legal counsel until 2018. The US, fixated on bioterrorism after 9/11, supported giving the organisation some extended powers, but was opposed by Brazil, Russia, India and China, which were wary of US influence. There was a general reluctance to hand an international organisation any more power. “WHO members were happy with the actions that were taken during Sars, but there was definitely a sense afterward of ‘What if that was us in China’s spot?’,” explained Catherine Worsnop, a professor at the University of Maryland School of Public Policy. In short: thanks for stopping the pandemic, but we don’t want to be told what to do.</p> <h2><strong>* * *</strong></h2> <p>If the WHO has seemed at times weak or tentative – very un-Brundtland-like – in its handling of the coronavirus crisis, it is partly because of its bruising experiences during the past decade. From 2009 onwards, the WHO faced condemnation from the press and the international community for its handling of successive crises, all during a decade when the financial and diplomatic order that sustained it began to break down.</p> <p>First, there was the outbreak of H1N1, or “swine flu”. The novel influenza virus was discovered in Mexico in March 2009, and by June, when the WHO declared a pandemic, there were more than 28,000 cases in 74 countries. Over the next year, the WHO coordinated the global response – less aggressively than during Sars – and on 10 August 2010, it declared the pandemic over. Almost immediately, the WHO’s approach came under scrutiny. The death toll – 18,500 confirmed deaths worldwide – was far lower than initially expected, particularly given the disease reached more than 200 countries. “Suddenly you have people saying: ‘Wait a minute, you really cried wolf on this,’” says Wenham. The media and several prominent European politicians demanded inquiries as to whether the WHO had mistakenly rung the alarm, and “cost huge amounts of money and frightened people unnecessarily”, as Paul Flynn, the former Labour MP who chaired one of the inquiries, told the Times in 2010.</p> <p>To this day, opinions are split as to whether H1N1 was a crisis headed off, or a false alarm. “The WHO is always at risk of being criticised as doing too much or too little,” said Keiji Fukuda, the former WHO assistant director general who led the H1N1 response. Most of the former WHO staff and academics I spoke with agreed, proposing some version of the following as an iron law of public health: act slowly and you will be criticised for failing to stop preventable deaths; act aggressively and stop an outbreak before it becomes serious, and you will be accused of having overreacted. (After all, in the latter case, nothing too bad happened, so what was the big deal in the first place?)</p> <p>Fidler, who largely approves of WHO’s quick action during H1N1, believes that the backlash led the WHO, which was then under the command of director general Margaret Chan, to become too tentative about calling for action in the future. This was a period when the fallout from the 2008 financial crisis was also starting to take its toll on its budget. “There was a big funding shortfall,” said Andrew Cassels, director of strategy at the WHO between 2008 and 2013. “Cuts made to the emergency response programmes, personnel cuts.” The funding gap stood at nearly $300m in 2012. Entire offices were shut, including a team of social scientists working on pandemic response.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"29cfebe6451704d592d057ee78cfddfd9ae9f240\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/29cfebe6451704d592d057ee78cfddfd9ae9f240/0_0_3000_1800/1000.jpg\" alt=\"WHO staff training nurses to use protective gear in Freetown, Sierra Leone during the 2014 ebola outbreak.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">WHO staff training nurses to use protective gear in Freetown, Sierra Leone during the 2014 ebola outbreak.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Michael Duff/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>When the Ebola outbreak struck west Africa in 2014, the combination of the WHO’s greater caution and reduced budget resulted in disaster. In contrast to the previous pandemic, this time the WHO was slow to act, and was widely perceived to have lost control of the situation. In the end, the US and several other nations <a href=\"https://www.lshtm.ac.uk/newsevents/news/2015/foreign_military_response_crucial_to_ebola.html\" title=\"\">deployed</a> more than 5,000 military personnel at the request of the affected countries, and an ad-hoc UN committee was created to take over responsibilities from the WHO. The outbreak eventually killed 11,310 people, the vast majority in just three countries – Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone – paralysing their health systems for months, and causing panic across the world. Prominent scientists <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/nov/22/experts-criticise-world-health-organisation-who-delay-ebola-outbreak\" title=\"\">judged</a> the WHO’s response an “egregious failure”.</p> <p>Much of the blame fell on Chan herself. She appeared shell-shocked, stressing to the press that the WHO was a technical advisory body, and that it was national governments that had ultimate responsibility for their citizens’ health. “She wanted the WHO to be an apolitical agency – more like technical support. There was a hesitancy there to push the full powers of the WHO,” said Sara Davies, a professor of global health at Griffith University in Australia.</p> <p>The bold, proactive culture established after Sars had seemingly faded. Fidler believes that by delaying calling Ebola an emergency, and thus failing to organise an international response at a crucial moment, the WHO’s leadership had shown they “no longer had any faith in their authority”.</p> <h2><strong>* * *</strong></h2> <p>Today, under Tedros, the WHO finds itself in uncharted territory. Not only is it facing by far the biggest pandemic in its history, it is also having to defend itself from the nations on which it most depends. “In my 25-plus years of working on global health issues, I cannot recall the leader of a prominent developed country threatening to punish WHO in the manner President Trump did,” said Fidler, referring to the recent press conference in which Trump suggested putting “a very powerful hold” on US contributions to the WHO. In the same press conference, Trump accused the WHO of concealing information, being too slow to react to the virus, and, above all, showing favouritism towards China.</p> <p>Since the crisis began, Tedros has been repeatedly accused of being soft on China. Senator Marco Rubio recently <a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/politics/bolton-joins-calls-for-who-directors-resignation-accomplice-to-chinas-massive-coverup\" title=\"\">told</a> Fox News that the Chinese government had “used the WHO to mislead the world”, and claimed that the WHO “is either complicit or dangerously incompetent”. The US senator Rick Scott put it more bluntly, accusing the WHO of “helping Communist China cover up a global pandemic”. (Tedros, meanwhile, has warned of the dangers of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global/video/2020/apr/09/politicising-covid-19-like-playing-with-fire-who-director-general-says-after-trump-attack-video\">politicising the virus</a>.)</p> <p>Until very recently, the WHO was seen as a relatively neutral arena for China to extend its power. “China likes to find ways within the global system to give it a leading and benevolent image. The WHO was an uncontroversial place to do it,” said Rana Mitter, the director of the University of Oxford China Centre. No longer. The extent of the initial coverup is still unclear, but there is no question that at least at the local level, Chinese officials knew about the outbreak of a novel disease for weeks before it was reported to the WHO. During that time, Chinese doctors were prevented from speaking out.</p> <p>John MacKenzie, the WHO’s emergency committee adviser, told me that the organisation was “a little misled” about the Wuhan outbreak. He says that by the time the government alerted the WHO on 31 December, scientists in China had already determined via genome sequencing that the outbreak was caused by coronavirus. Yet the government didn’t confirm that until 7 January and the full genome sequence was not officially shared until 12 January. “That’s very slow,” MacKenzie told me. “For at least two weeks, we could have been making far more kits and so on for testing.” MacKenzie added that the number of cases officially declared by the Chinese in the first week – 59 in the week ending 5 January – was “nowhere near as many cases as you’d expect”. (The statistics released by the Chinese government continue to be questioned, with some <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/03/world/asia/coronavirus-china-grief-deaths.html?auth=login-email&amp;login=email\" title=\"\">reports</a> suggesting they may have seriously understated the number of coronavirus deaths.)</p> <p>Despite mounting frustrations – in mid-January, China also refused the WHO’s request to send a team of scientific observers to Hubei province, the centre of the outbreak – Tedros has never come close to doing what Brundtland did and calling China out. Instead, on 28 January, he had a closed-door meeting with Xi Jinping in Beijing, and two days later, he praised Chinese efforts to contain the disease, declaring that China is “setting a new standard for outbreak control”. That same day, 30 January, the WHO declared a Pheic, and began issuing prescriptions to countries around the world. On 8 February, China finally allowed WHO observers into the country. For Tedros’s supporters, this was vindication of his strategy of keeping China onside. For his critics, it was too little, too late.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"10a09ac53b686e3d6a7da5a1660151fdfce8847e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/10a09ac53b686e3d6a7da5a1660151fdfce8847e/0_177_3996_2398/1000.jpg\" alt=\"WHO director-general Adhanom Ghebreyesus with Chinese President Xi Jinping in Beijing on 28 January 2020.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">WHO director-general Adhanom Ghebreyesus with Chinese President Xi Jinping in Beijing on 28 January 2020.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Naohiko Hatta/AFP via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Elected as WHO director general in July 2017, Tedros was supported by a bloc of African and Asian countries, including China, which has considerable influence with those members. (Tedros is himself from Ethiopia, where he served as health minister and then foreign minister between 2005 and 2016.) It was a “really nasty” election, said Davies, in which the powers that have traditionally shaped the WHO, such as the US, UK and Canada, lent their support to one of Tedros’s rivals, the British doctor David Nabarro. During the campaign, Tedros was criticised for having served in a repressive government with a poor human rights record, and one of Nabarro’s backers even <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/may/23/who-elects-first-ever-african-director-general-after-tense-vote-tedros-adhanom-ghebreyesus\" title=\"\">accused</a> Tedros of covering up a cholera epidemic during his time as health minister. (Tedros <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/13/health/candidate-who-director-general-ethiopia-cholera-outbreaks.html\" title=\"\">denied the</a> claim, describing it as a “last-minute smear campaign”, while Nabarro told the New York Times that he had never authorised his team to make this accusation against Tedros.) In response, Tedros’s supporters mounted “a collective pushback”, said Davies, against the UK and its allies, eventually winning out. Tedros became the first director general from a so-called developing country since the Brazilian Dr Marcolino Gomes Candau in 1953.</p> <p>While his background is in politics, Tedros is not forthright or confrontational like Brundtland. In Ethiopia, his political party, the Tigray People’s Liberation Front (TPLF) was mostly comprised of ex-revolutionaries, men that “seemed carved out of a rock”, said Fantu Cheru, a professor at American University and former advisor to the Ethiopian government. Tedros was different – jovial and accessible, said Cheru, and able to make personal connections easily. “He is not very ideological, he believes he can work with anyone,” said Mehari Taddele Maru, a professor at the European University Institute in Florence, Italy. Cheru also sees Tedros as a pragmatist. “He’s not in the Chinese pocket. The Americans in particular wanted to destroy his image. Tedros knows how this game works. You need to have more allies than enemies, and those allies may not have a good track record.”</p> <p>“I don’t think Tedros did anything previous director generals would not have done,” said Anthony Costello, the director of the UCL Institute for Global Health. “He needed a good relationship with China in order to get in.” Even Lawrence Gostin, who has been a prominent critic of Tedros in the past, told me that “his high praise for China is understandable. He is seeking to coax China into cooperation.” He went on to note, though, that this strategy “does risk the credibility of WHO as an objective agency.”</p> <p>If the WHO thought it could sacrifice a bit of its credibility – overlooking China’s obvious blunders in December and January in exchange for its compliance in February – and move on, it was mistaken. The argument over China’s influence has been raging for weeks, not least since the government of Taiwan <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-coronavirus-taiwan/taiwan-says-who-ignored-its-coronavirus-questions-at-start-of-outbreak-idUSKBN21B160\" title=\"\">claimed</a> that the WHO had ignored its own early reports of human-to-human transmission of coronavirus as part of a larger history of appeasing China – which has blocked Taiwan from joining the WHO (and the UN) for decades.</p> <p>Now that Trump, scrambling for an answer to explain why the US now has <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/08/coronavirus-world-map-which-countries-have-most-cases-deaths-covid-19\" title=\"\">more cases</a> of coronavirus than any other nation, has alighted upon the WHO and China as his preferred scapegoats, these questions will not go away. “I don’t think we will see the US government cut off funding,” said Fidler. “But what’s happened with this pandemic – with the WHO caught between the US/China rivalry – is not a good omen for the WHO going forward.”</p> <h2><strong>* * *</strong></h2> <p>While the focus has been on what happened between China and the WHO in January, in epidemiological terms the crisis has moved on. Covid-19 has spread fastest and furthest in the US and Europe, through the very rich nations that largely fund and staff the WHO. Before the outbreak, the WHO struggled to get these same nations to prepare for future pandemics. Now the pandemic is here, and they are at the centre of the crisis, the WHO has been unable to keep them following its advice.</p> <p>Richard Horton of the Lancet said that after the WHO declared a public health emergency, “countries, especially western countries, didn’t listen. Or didn’t seek to understand what was actually taking place in China.” On 5 February, the WHO <a href=\"https://www.who.int/news-room/detail/05-02-2020-us-675-million-needed-for-new-coronavirus-preparedness-and-response-global-plan\" title=\"\">asked for</a> $675m to fund its Coronavirus response through to April. Anthony Costello of UCL said that when he met with Tedros on 4 March, the WHO had received only $1.2m. (Tedros announced last week that the funding goal had finally been reached, around the time the number of worldwide cases passed 1 million.)</p> <p>Even the decision to declare a pandemic on 13 March – a largely rhetorical distinction, since calling a Pheic already requires WHO members to respond – was calculated to wake its member states up. In the UK the Premier League was still playing games, and the previous week the US had held primary election contests. “They declared a pandemic because countries weren’t taking the advice,” said Adam Kamradt-Scott, a professor of global health at the University of Sydney.</p> <p>The WHO stresses that the ideal response to the crisis is relatively simple. Individual states should limit public exposure, especially by tracking and tracing all known cases – a strategy that worked in South Korea and appears to be working in Germany. On an international level, states should share scientific information and resources. These are the mantras Tedros goes back to in his briefings: “Test test test” and “solidarity solidarity solidarity”.</p> <p>But countries have repeatedly ignored WHO advice. In the UK, the response has been erratic, lurching between the WHO’s norms and its own strategies, such as the now-discredited pursuit of “herd immunity”. The US didn’t recommend school closures or avoiding travel until 16 March. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/05/sweden-prepares-to-tighten-coronavirus-measures-as-death-toll-climbs\" title=\"\">In Sweden</a>, restaurants are still open.</p> <p>Many wealthy nations have not only pursued their own national strategies for public health, but have also withdrawn from the globalised world of diplomacy and trade that they themselves set up. Earlier this year, for instance, the NHS <a href=\"https://www.euronews.com/2020/03/06/coronavirus-french-protective-mask-manufacturer-scraps-nhs-order-to-keep-masks-in-france\" title=\"\">ordered</a> millions of masks from a French company named Valmy SAS. But in early March, the French government requisitioned all masks produced within the country, so the masks never reached Britain. This week, Germany <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/03/mask-wars-coronavirus-outbidding-demand\" title=\"\">accused the US</a> of seizing a shipment of masks bound for Berlin from a port in Thailand; while Germany previously <a href=\"https://www.rheinische-anzeigenblaetter.de/region/bonn/beim-us-konzern-3m-zoll-kontrollierte-schutzmasken-und-schutzkleidung-36443358\" title=\"\">sent inspectors</a> to the factory of an American company in Jüchen to ensure their medical masks weren’t being exported against government orders.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/27/inside-the-race-to-develop-a-coronavirus-vaccine-covid-19\">\\'It’s a razor’s edge we’re walking\\': inside the race to develop a coronavirus vaccine</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The WHO is battling against a breakdown in international cooperation that is far beyond its capacity to control. “Governments have retreated to national policies, and this problem predates this crisis,” said Clare Wenham, the health scholar. States have been turning away from international institutions for a long time. The WHO hasn’t driven globalisation in the same way as the WTO or IMF, but in a way it has administered it – quietly promising to take on the outbreaks that arise in an industrialised and interconnected world, and relying on the often unspoken norms of international collaboration that underlie it.</p> <p>Ironically, it is most needed now, at a time when faith in the other administrators and overseers of the global order are in decline – a trend that Covid-19 only seems to be accelerating. “As it’s gone on, you see the WHO becoming less important,” said Wenham. “No one is thinking about reducing the global numbers, only their own. The WHO is a global force, but people aren’t thinking globally.”</p> <p>• Follow the Long Read on Twitter at <a href=\"https://twitter.com/gdnlongread\" title=\"\">@gdnlongread</a>, and sign up to the long read weekly email <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/info/ng-interactive/2017/may/05/sign-up-for-the-long-read-email\" title=\"\">here</a>.</p>',\n",

       "   'body': '<p>The head of the British Medical Association has called on the government to urgently investigate if and why black, Asian and minority ethnic people are more vulnerable to Covid-19, after <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/18/not-ready-to-go-tributes-paid-to-uk-first-named-victims-of-coronavirus\">the first 10 doctors in the UK named as having died from the virus were all BAME</a>.</p> \\n<p>Those doctors have ancestry in regions including Asia, the Middle East and Africa. Even allowing for the overrepresentation of BAME staff in the NHS – <a href=\"https://www.ethnicity-facts-figures.service.gov.uk/workforce-and-business/workforce-diversity/nhs-workforce/latest\">they comprise 44% of medical staff</a> compared with 14% of the population of England and Wales – the fact that they were all from ethnic minorities was “extremely disturbing and worrying”, the BMA chair said.</p> \\n<p>“At face value, it seems hard to see how this can be random – to have the first 10 doctors of all being of BAME background,” Dr Chaand Nagpaul said. “Not only that, we also know that in terms of the BAME population, they make up about a third of those in intensive care. There’s a disproportionate percentage of BAME people getting ill.</p> \\n<p>“We have heard the virus does not discriminate between individuals but there’s no doubt there appears to be a manifest disproportionate severity of infection in BAME people and doctors. This has to be addressed – the government must act now.”</p> \\n<p>As well as the 10 doctors, three out of six nurses named as having died have also been BAME as was a hospital pharmacist and at least one healthcare assistant. The overall death figures in the UK have not been broken down by ethnicity but early research published this week showed that<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/07/bame-groups-hit-harder-covid-19-than-white-people-uk\"> 35% of almost 2,000 patients in intensive care units were non-white</a>.</p> \\n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"070e1ce7-43bd-462f-80b5-0be91d966238\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \\n  <div>\\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/XPF35H9RLNE?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\\n  </div>\\n </gu-atom> \\n</figure> \\n<h2>Nagpaul said BAME health professionals were understandably concerned about the deaths of their colleagues and what it might mean for them. The BMA chair said it might be too early to get firm answers but that it needed to be investigated.</h2> \\n<p>Among the factors he speculated could be contributing was whether BAME doctors felt less able to complain about inadequate personal protective equipment (PPE) – <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/06/nhs-doctors-lacking-ppe-bullied-into-treating-covid-19-patients\">a recurring complaint among healthcare workers during the crisis</a> – thereby putting themselves in danger.</p> \\n<p>“<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jun/02/black-nhs-staff-more-likely-bullied-than-white-colleagues\">BAME doctors often feel bullied and harassed at higher levels</a> compared to their white counterparts,” he said. “They are twice as likely not to raise concerns because of fears of recrimination.”</p> \\n<p>He said the death of BAME doctors was particularly upsetting because of “the vast majority – I think only one was born here – who have come from overseas and have given their lives to the NHS, to save the lives of others”.</p> \\n<p>Among the wider BAME population, he suggested the fact that many were in key worker roles, combined with their living arrangements, could be contributing to their disproportionate presence in intensive care units.</p> \\n<p>“You’ve got a high proportion of BAME people not able to stay at home, serving the nation, putting themselves at risk,” he said. “If you add that to overcrowded and multigenerational occupancies, the infections can be brought back home and spread to other members of the family.”</p> \\n<p>Nagpaul questioned whether enough was being done in terms of translating information leaflets about Covid-19 and physical distancing for people for whom English is a second language, suggesting mosques and temples could be used by the government to help relay the message. He said difficulties speaking English could lead to problems accessing NHS 111 either online or on the phone.</p> \\n<p>Nagpaul also highlighted the higher prevalence of diabetes, heart disease and kidney disease among BAME communities than in the white population, adding: “Previous inequalities will be greater at a time of crisis. This [coronavirus] may be bringing into focus historic inequalities facing BAME communities.”</p> \\n<figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Callout callout-coronavirus\"> <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"<html><head></head><body><div data-callout-tagname=&quot;callout-coronavirus&quot;> <h2>Callout</h2> <p>callout-coronavirus</p> </div></body></html>\"></iframe> \\n</figure> \\n<p>He said the best advice for BAME doctors to protect themselves against Covid-19 until more was known about the virus was the same as for any of their colleagues: ensure they are wearing appropriate PPE. He urged them not to risk their life if it was not forthcoming.</p> \\n<p>“We need to safeguard our BAME population and the BAME medical officers,” he said “These are workers who are <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2019/jun/25/nhs-treating-minority-ethnic-doctors-as-outsiders\">already experiencing significant hardships working for the NHS</a>. They are serving the nation at a time of unprecedented crisis. The government must take steps to address this.”</p> \\n<p>The Department of Health and Social Care said it was working hard to protect all communities, adding that translations of the public information leaflet, posted to all 30 million households in the UK, were <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/coronavirus-covid-19-information-leaflet\">available on its website</a>.</p>',\n",

How are they doing, and how is the lockdown affecting their puzzles?</p> <p>Looking at the first question first, you will be happy to hear that, on the whole, everyone seems largely well. As with the nation at large, we see the Great Time Availability Disparity. Some setters, with day jobs or volunteering cancelled, have far more time than usual to ponder crosswords. And many of the younger ones are having to schedule slots for setting where allowed by their new jobs as home-based teaching assistants.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/crosswords/crossword-blog/2013/jul/11/crossword-blog-meet-setter-otterden\">Maskarade</a>, for example, had a very busy 2019 doing double the usual amount of work in his other capacity as proof-reader for puzzle magazines in an effort to have six months’ worth of crosswords ready for Brexit (“where is that now, news-wise!?”, he adds) and now has “a lovely hiatus” offering puzzle time.

A big national event usually appears in puzzle form, if not in full-on themed crosswords, then via amusing references in clues. But it’s a long time since we wryly noted that coronavirus is <a href=\"https://discussion.theguardian.com/comment-permalink/138279283\">an anagram of carnivorous</a> (a fact that, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/crosswords/crossword-blog/2011/sep/22/crossword-blog-meet-the-setter-paul\">Paul</a> tells us, his vegan neighbour is keen on).</p> <p>At any rate, many papers avoid references to illness in their puzzles whether there’s a pandemic or not; for some it’s a “must not” and for others a “should not”, a mixture a little like government advice. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/crosswords/crossword-blog/2017/apr/10/crossword-blog-meet-the-setter-nutmeg\">Nutmeg</a> recently reworked a grid to remove an unfortunate “endemic” in a corner: an example of a word which can have a completely non-medical meaning but which nobody wants to come across when trying to relax with a crossword during a lockdown.

This disproved the idea of herd immunity, which requires widespread infection, as a viable policy option, he said.</p> \\n<p>However, researchers, <a href=\"https://www.meinbezirk.at/c-politik/der-berg-ist-hoeher-als-gedacht-laut-stichproben-erhebung-bis-zu-67400-infiziert_a4028091\">speaking at a press conference</a> to release the results, said the study provided only a “snapshot” and did not account for asymptomatic infections, or people who were immune.</p> \\n<p>“We did not find out how many people are immune, but only how many people in Austria are currently acutely infected,” said Günther Ogris, from Sora.</p> \\n<p>The issue of the <a href=\"https://www.bmj.com/content/369/bmj.m1375\">proportion of asymptomatic infections</a> in the population remains highly contested, with a World Health Organization report in February suggesting truly asymptomatic cases were relatively rare. However, another small Chinese study, reported in the British Medical Journal earlier this month, posited that up to four-fifths of all infections could be without symptoms.</p> \\n<p>Ogris said Sora had “defined the population as all people living in Austria”, and added that the youngest test subject was not yet a year old, and the oldest was aged 94.</p> \\n<p>Commenting on the result, the science minister, Heinz Fassmann, said it indicated a low rate of immunity, which meant that without controls there was a continued risk of an exponential growth in infections.</p> \\n<p>“The mountain is higher than expected and we are not yet on the safe side,” he said.</p> \\n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \\n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/30/optimistic-nihilism-thomas-glavinics-ploy-for-getting-through-the-covid-19-crisis\">Paper prints Austrian author\\'s \\'coronavirus novel\\' in daily instalments</a> </p> \\n</aside> \\n<p>Austria’s current policy is to test people with symptoms, especially if they have been to a known hotspot or in close contact with an infected individual. That means many people, such as those with no symptoms, or no known contact to an at-risk area, go undetected.</p> \\n<p>The country reacted early to the outbreak, closing schools, restaurants, theatres and other gathering places more than three weeks ago, and telling people to stay home.</p> \\n<figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Callout callout-coronavirus\"> <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"<html><head></head><body><div data-callout-tagname=&quot;callout-coronavirus&quot;> <h2>Callout</h2> <p>callout-coronavirus</p> </div></body></html>\"></iframe> \\n</figure> \\n<p>Hospital admissions have stabilised, with the daily percentage increase in infections in low single digits. There have been 319 deaths and 13,337 confirmed cases, of which about 7,000 people are still infected. The study estimated the current number of infections was more than four times that, however, at around 28,500 people. It excluded those in hospital, currently about 1,000 people.</p> \\n<p>The study, conducted from 1-6 April, tested 1,554 people. It did not involve antibody tests, which can tell whether a person was previously infected and is therefore probably immune. Future studies should involve antibody tests, the government has said, to inform policy as the country starts to reopen shops from 14 April.</p> \\n<p>The education minister, Heinz Fassmann, whose portfolio includes research, said: “We must monitor whether there is a second wave and the number of infected people starts to rise again. We are still in a very, very sensitive situation. This study shows that, too. Corona is in our society.” </p>',\n",

One tabloid has accused Emmanuel Macron’s administration in France of using coronavirus “to destabilise French-speaking African countries”. Others described the arrival of the infected Italian as “the poisoning of an entire people” and have raged about “a genocide” against Africans.</p> <p>“The spike in threats and violence against foreigners and humanitarian personnel, also spread by the media, pose significant safety and security risks that can result in reduced operations when they are needed the most,” said the UN’s <a href=\"https://www.unocha.org/sites/unocha/files/Global-Humanitarian-Response-Plan-COVID-19.pdf\">Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs</a> (Ocha) in a recent report. “The aid pipeline could face ruptures and stock-outs, depriving the most affected people from the only existing safety net.”</p> <p>Humanitarian groups fear the impact of the pandemic in CAR could be disastrous. After <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2019/nov/29/central-african-republic-seeks-a-salve-for-the-scars-of-war-new-court-bangui\">years of sectarian violence</a>, the country’s health infrastructure is virtually nonexistent; rebel militias control three-quarters of its territory, and 600,000 people have been uprooted from their homes into <a href=\"https://www.unhcr.org/uk/central-african-republic-situation.html\">overcrowded displacement camps</a>.</p> <p>Less than a dozen coronavirus cases have so far been registered, although many more are suspected given the lack of testing equipment.</p> <p>“People are very worried about this new disease,” said Maaike Hersevoort, chief of Médecins Sans Frontières in CAR. “They associate foreigners with corona. If engagement is not done well then there could be an escalation.”</p> <p>CAR’s government has made moves to rein in the sensationalist coverage of coronavirus. On Wednesday, health minister Pierre Somsé released a code of conduct for reporting on the outbreak responsiblyand asked for “respect for human rights [and] solidarity, both nationally and internationally”.</p> <p>There are warnings that displaced people living in host communities could be denigrated as virus-spreading outsiders too, as could members of <a href=\"https://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/features/2017/07/muslims-return-car-find-homes-170711140733834.html\">CAR’s Muslim minority</a> – long marginalised as “Arab foreigners”.</p> <p>Growing tensions could lead to fresh clashes. “Increased xenophobia against several segments of the population poses a high risk of resurgence of intercommunal violence and conflict,” said Ocha.</p> <p>There is widespread distrust in CAR of the French, the country’s former colonial rulers, while regional neighbours <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-sudan-chad-car-factbox/factbox-chad-car-sudan-triangle-is-crucible-of-violence-idUSL0367043220070503\">Chad and Sudan have interfered with CAR</a>’s internal affairs for decades.

In recent months, an influential pressure group in CAR’s capital, Bangui, has targeted Minusca with an aggressive smear campaign, calling the peacekeepers “the Minuscavirus”.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2020/apr/08/coronavirus-in-africa-what-happens-next\">Coronavirus in Africa: what happens next?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>“Other international organisations are paying the price for the UN mission’s mistakes,” said Fridolin Ngoulou, a Central African journalist. “But this should not be a reason to attack foreigners.”</p> <p>The challenges were brought into sharp relief by an incident last week, when paramedics in protective gear arrived to collect a member of Minusca’s international staff in Bangui, who was showing symptoms of Covid-19, and had to face down a hostile crowd. </p> <p>“Of course there’s frustration,” said Denise Brown, the humanitarian coordinatorin CAR. “People’s everyday lives are really difficult.

       "   'body': '<p>“How long do I have?” replied Intisar Chowdhury, when asked on the radio how he would like his father, a doctor, to be remembered. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/09/consultant-who-pleaded-for-more-nhs-hospital-ppe-dies-of-coronavirus\" title=\"\">Abdul Mabud Chowdhury</a>, who was 53, died this week at Queen’s hospital in Romford, east London, two weeks after being taken to hospital with coronavirus – and three weeks after appealing directly to the prime minister on Facebook for more personal protective equipment (PPE) for medical staff, and fast-track access to testing.</p> <p>It is not only by his son, wife and 11-year-old daughter that Mr Chowdhury, who was a consultant, deserves to be remembered as a hero. But as UK deaths continue to mount – the official tally is now around 9,000, with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/09/covid-19-hundreds-of-uk-care-home-deaths-not-added-to-official-toll\" title=\"\">up to 1,000 people</a> who have died in care homes yet to be added – the tens of thousands who are mourning a close family member, and many others who have lost a friend, colleague or neighbour, are too occupied with private grief to demand a public accounting.</p> <p>Countless others are suffering the financial shocks caused by unemployment, with far worse to come. Meanwhile, the toll of the crisis on those with vulnerabilities including mental health difficulties and social isolation has barely begun to be measured. The nation, like many others, is in a state of shock – a mood of mingled fear and disbelief that was heightened by the events of the past week, during which the prime minister received treatment in the intensive care unit of St Thomas’ hospital.</p> <p>Boris Johnson remains ill in hospital. The Guardian wishes him a full and speedy recovery. His family, particularly his pregnant partner, Carrie Symonds, and his children, deserve every sympathy. His government, however, must continue to submit to forensic scrutiny. All the evidence suggests that its decision-making was poor, placing human lives such as Mr Chowdhury’s at increased risk (though it is not yet known whether the lack of PPE was a factor in his case). Of particular interest are the crucial four weeks between late February and the start of the lockdown on 23 March.</p> <p>One must always be cautious about apportioning blame with the benefit of hindsight. This is never more true than when confronting unprecedented events. But ministers’ decision to disregard the example set by east Asian countries in January, and the failure to prioritise testing and the sourcing of vital equipment (ventilators, masks), have cost lives. Suggestions that, as recently as a month ago, Mr Johnson was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/audio/2020/apr/10/coronavirus-100-days-that-changed-the-world-part-2-podcast\" title=\"\">worried about the impact of a lockdown</a> on his popularity, and feared that northern voters would object to pubs being shut, require closer examination. That the UK’s coronavirus strategy could have been influenced by such narrowly political calculations and stereotypes is horrifying.</p> <p>The lines between public and private life are being redrawn. The role of social media, the millions of people working and schooling from home, restrictions on travel: these factors and others mean that our society is being transformed. Support for the health service has probably never been stronger, as ministers knew when they created the slogan “Stay at home, protect the NHS, save lives”.</p> <p>The efforts of hospitals, care homes, social services and key workers including supermarket staff must continue to be clapped. But the spirit of national togetherness should not be invoked to fend off legitimate criticism. With deaths <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/09/uk-coronavirus-peak-at-least-two-weeks-away-chief-scientist-says\" title=\"\">expected to keep rising</a> for two more weeks, the bleakest sorrow awaits tens of thousands more families. Those lucky enough to escape the worst can still rage against the dying of lights such as Mr Chowdhury’s.</p>',\n",

Despite this, staff and students across the UK are launching initiatives to support both their local community and the NHS.</p> <p>Harrogate grammar school, a comprehensive in North Yorkshire, has repurposed its design department as a PPE production line, and has made more than 1,000 visors so far.</p> <p>Its headteacher, Neil Renton, said: “We’ve had parents who’ve been furloughed or lost jobs, who are ex-engineers, asking if they can help. We’ve not been able to support that as we’ve had so many staff members volunteer. I think it comes from an overwhelming desire from our teachers, who believe in public service, to make a difference.”</p> <p>The visors have been sent to local hospitals, paramedics and GP surgeries, as well as alumni working on the frontline.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"d434b6ad277578068da59bf884904f5f30adb9be\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d434b6ad277578068da59bf884904f5f30adb9be/0_257_739_922/401.jpg\" alt=\"Staff at Harrogate district hospital wear visors made at Harrogate grammar school\" width=\"401\" height=\"500\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Staff at Harrogate district hospital wear visors made at Harrogate grammar school</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Harrogate grammar school/Guardian Community</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Jack Sheriff, who left the school in 2014, is a junior doctor on a coronavirus ward in the Midlands, and received a pack of six visors last week, stamped with the school’s emblem, the NHS logo, and the message “we stand together”.</p> <p>He said: “It’s really nice to have contact with people from your past who helped you get to where you are, and who are still supporting you and thinking of you. It’s a bit of a blast from the past to be under that logo again, and nice to be using the visors made by the laser cutter I used at school.”</p> <p>Schools are used to providing support for their more vulnerable students but since the crisis, extraordinary efforts are being made to help communities.</p> <p>At Meadowfield primary school in Leeds, almost half the students are entitled to free school meals. As well as providing hot meals for families to collect each day, the school has sent out 145 food parcels containing enough supplies for two weeks, with the aim of sustaining vulnerable families over the Easter holidays.</p> <p>The headteacher, Helen Stout, said: “The butchers we use as a supplier have offered to give us bacon and sausages, and the local grocers have offered to do some delivery for us. People have been really kind and benevolent, and it’s nice to know we’re doing our bit.</p> <p>“It’s become a bit of a different role. It’s not just being head of a primary school, it’s managing community spirit.”</p> <p>Alongside staff-led directives to support pupils, students are embracing initiatives to celebrate and assist the key workers around them.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"ea34b9efac47b683b9e917c52348233434335630\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ea34b9efac47b683b9e917c52348233434335630/0_29_790_474/500.jpg\" alt=\"Staff at Meadowfield primary school in Leeds prepare to deliver supplies to families\" width=\"500\" height=\"300\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Staff at Meadowfield primary school in Leeds prepare to deliver supplies to families in their local community.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Meadowfield primary school/Guardian Community</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>At Thornhill College in Derry, many students expressed their fear and anxiety at the pandemic, many of whom had family and friends working on the frontline of the NHS.

Along with the tributes, the school set up a fundraiser for their local hospital, with a target of £500 – a figure that has been trebled in just two days.</p> <p>“It really has taken on a life of its own,” said Orla Donnelly, the vice-principal. “We’ve been swamped with people paying tribute to NHS workers, saying what they’re doing and why they’re so proud.

       "   'body': '<p>On the Andrew Marr Show last Sunday, speaking about Covid-19, Prof Neil Ferguson was described as being “more influential right now than any politician”. Ferguson <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/18/neil-ferguson-coronavirus-expert-who-is-working-on-despite-symptoms\">leads a team of modellers</a> at Imperial College London whose mission has been to predict the pattern and health impact of coronavirus transmission in the UK under different scenarios, and thereby help government make the right decisions about how best to protect the population.</p> \\n<p>The UK has some of the best infectious disease modellers in the world, and the government has been wise to draw upon their expertise. But all models have their limitations, and none can avoid the fact that decision-making must also be informed by people with relevant expertise and experience, and by the facts on the ground. In the case of Covid-19, where so much about the disease and its transmission dynamics is still unknown or unclear, models are useful – but experience and sound judgment are crucial.</p> \\n<p>This is becoming apparent across the world. Countries that lived through the experience of Sars and Mers appear to have been better prepared to deal with Covid-19 than those that didn’t. And in Canada, <a href=\"https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/bc-ontario-quebec-covid-19-1.5524056\">the success of British Columbia</a> in controlling Covid-19 compared with other provinces has been partly attributable to the combined ingredients of political experience and good judgment.</p> \\n<p>There is also a non-scientific element to decision-making which involves choosing between competing demands and needs in society, determining what is ethical and moral, and balancing challenges that are current and immediate with those that will only emerge in the future. For example, a model that incorporates value judgments is needed to balance the direct, visible and dramatic harms of Covid-19 with the more indirect, chronic and hidden social and economic harms of lockdown.</p> \\n<p>Furthermore, while it is often said that Covid-19 “does not discriminate”, this statement is only partially true. The virus disproportionately affects older people and men; and we can be sure that the effects of both the virus and the collateral damage of control measures will <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/apr/09/coronavirus-inequality-managers-zoom-cleaners-offices\">disproportionately affect the poorer and more marginalised</a> segments of society. How we manage this differentiated vulnerability is all about ethics and politics. It may be informed by a scientific model, but it shouldn’t be disguised as a technocratic problem that can be resolved by mathematical equations.</p> \\n<p>It is easy to be entranced by the cleverness of models that map, measure and predict the complex interactions of multiple natural and social variables. There is something impressive about the ability to produce answers in the form of precisely calculated numbers, and professionally crafted charts and graphs. And for politicians, nothing is more convenient than being able to say that they are merely following “<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/mar/25/uk-coronavirus-policy-scientific-dominic-cummings\">the science</a>” and evidence.</p> \\n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"ba9786c6-c779-4063-8bf9-1d3009eb7c70\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \\n  <div>\\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/3qV7R2iYVXg?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\\n  </div>\\n </gu-atom> \\n</figure> \\n<p>While Marr’s comment about Ferguson being the most influential person in the country was rhetorical, it hints at the perception that epidemiological modelling has played a disproportionately influential role in shaping the UK’s strategy and plans. Others have pointed out that some of the earlier modelling work had gaps that have adversely affected policy decisions. These include not accounting for the potential role of testing and contact tracing in mitigating the epidemic; not modelling the impact of sick patients on intensive care beds and other parts of the health system; and not modelling the epidemic across different regions of the UK.</p> \\n<p>It is not clear what caused these omissions. Perhaps they were the result of blindspots that persisted due to the lack of external scrutiny and challenge. In the case of the sidelining of testing and contact tracing, perhaps it was because the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage) had concluded that these measures were not worth while – a view that is understandable if Sage also saw the building up of herd immunity through natural infection as part of its strategy.</p> \\n<p>There has been lots of speculation as to why the UK delayed lockdown compared with other countries; why it was slow to increase viral testing capacity; and why the NHS was left so poorly prepared. Now is not the time to look backwards. Neither would I want to place any criticism on modellers. Rigorous modelling is done by clever modellers; but the design and testing of models, including the assumptions built into models and the questions that modellers have been asked to help answer, is a collective responsibility.</p> \\n<p>Modelling is vital and could assist greatly in going forward. In particular, two things should be urgently modelled. The first is to model the impact of different strategies that will help us avoid the harms of draconian, population-wide lockdown. This should include modelling the costs and benefits of weekly viral testing of the whole population (not 100,000 tests a day, but 10 million tests a day), or a more modest but greatly expanded testing regime, combined with aggressive case detection and contact tracing, coupled with continued physical distancing and improved hygiene. The former idea may sound radical and extreme, but is a serious proposal that could be implemented if there was sufficient political will.</p> \\n<p>Second, we must model (and then keep monitoring) the health and socioeconomic impacts of both the virus and the control measures, with short-, medium- and long-term timeframes, and with a social lens to look at how the virus has impacted differentially across society. For some reason, there was no modelling of the socioeconomic impact of lockdown. This was an omission – and as we enter the beginning of what could be a global economic recession, we could see thousands of lives cut short from this collateral damage.</p> \\n<p>Finally, from a policymaking perspective, there are two things needed. First, we need greater transparency and participation to allow effective scrutiny and challenge from scientists and public health specialists who are more independent of government. This will avoid the danger of groupthink and blindspots. Second, we must better acknowledge the limitations of evidence-based policy and recognise the importance of expertise, experience and sound judgment.</p> \\n<p>• David McCoy is a professor of Global Public Health and director of the Centre for Public Health at Queen Mary University of London.</p>',\n",

WHO wants to see restrictions lifted as much as anyone,” he told a virtual press conference in Geneva. “At the same time, lifting restrictions too quickly could lead to a deadly resurgence. The way down can be as dangerous as the way up if not managed properly.”</p> <p>America’s top infectious disease expert also cautioned against moves to relax restrictions, echoing calls from other global public health officials but putting him at odds with Donald Trump, who is agitating for a reopening of the coronavirus-battered US economy.</p> <p>Anthony Fauci said “now is not the time to back off” on restrictions, despite what he described as “favourable signs” in America’s early hotspots.</p> <p>“We would want to see a clear indication that you were very, very clearly and strongly going in the right direction, because the one thing you don’t want to do is you don’t want to get out there prematurely and then wind up back in the same situation,” the senior adviser to the White House <a href=\"https://edition.cnn.com/videos/health/2020/04/10/dr-anthony-fauci-coronavirus-full-interview-newday-vpx.cnn\">told CNN</a>.</p> <p>Trump, seemingly concerned by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/apr/10/trump-poll-numbers-dip-handling-coronavirus\">deflating approval ratings</a> and exploding unemployment figures, had told reporters that he hoped to open up the economy “very, very, very, very soon”.</p> <p>On Friday, the president struck a more emollient tone, saying he would announce next week a council of business and medical leaders to help him with the “biggest decision I’ve ever had to make” on when to reopen America for business.</p> <p>Trump added: “I want to get it open as soon as possible. This country was meant to be open and vibrant and great ... The facts are going to determine what I do. But we do want to get the country open.”</p> <p>According to <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/national/trump-reopen-us-economy/2020/04/09/10d42b4a-7a7b-11ea-9bee-c5bf9d2e3288_story.html\">a report in the Washington Post</a>, the US president wants to reopen the country next month despite concerns from both economists and health experts that America’s coronavirus pandemic is nowhere near over.</p> <p>Nancy Pelosi, the Democratic speaker of the House of Representatives, also warned Trump against trying to get back to normality prematurely. “I would hope that the scientific community would weigh in and say, ‘You can’t do this, it is only going to make matters worse if you go out too soon,’” Pelosi said in an interview with Politico.</p> <p>US deaths owing to the coronavirus topped 17,000 on Friday, although there were signs that Americans staying home was curbing new infections. More than 7,000 people have died in New York State alone, but its governor, Andrew Cuomo, expressed cautious optimism on Friday that the state’s infection rate was slowing.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Let’s see to what extent the actions of the American government will lead to discussions in the US about whether the ‘America first’ model really works</p> <footer> <cite>Heiko Maas, Germany\\'s foreign minister</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>In the latest sign of tensions with the US, Germany’s foreign minister, Heiko Maas, criticised the Trump administration’s handling of the outbreak as too slow.</p> <p>In a preview of an interview for Der Spiegel, Maas took aim at the two extremes of national coronavirus responses, contrasting China’s “very authoritarian measures” with America’s decision to play down the threat “for a very long time”. </p> <p>“These are two extremes, neither of which can be a model for Europe,” Maas said.</p> <p>A German official last week accused the US of “wild west” tactics in outbidding for or blocking shipments of vital medical supplies, and Maas said he hoped the US would rethink its international relationships in light of the crisis.</p> <p>.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"992f5e011dce07d034faa86d2c3f21707fa414a6\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/992f5e011dce07d034faa86d2c3f21707fa414a6/0_0_4608_3456/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Taiwanese Archbishop John Hung Shan-chuan and priests after celebrating the Chrism Mass behind closed doors at the Holy Family Church in Taipei.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"750\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Taiwanese archbishop John Hung Shan-chuan and priests after celebrating the Chrism Mass behind closed doors at the Holy Family Church in Taipei.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: David Chang/EPA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In Asia, China weighed in on a growing row between the WHO and Taiwan, accusing Taiwan’s government of “unscrupulously using the virus to seek independence”.</p> <p>The WHO and Taiwan have been trading accusations in recent days, largely stemming from <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/03/hong-kong-official-reprimands-tv-station-over-who-interview-that-mentioned-taiwan\">Taiwan’s continued exclusion from the body’s membership</a> and activities because of lobbying by China, which claims Taiwan as Chinese territory.

Any serious attempt to grapple with China’s role in this pandemic must also consider the specific political-economic conditions of China’s ascent within the global market in recent years, which facilitated the virus’s spread as well as planting the seeds for an Euro-American backlash.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>These dangerous sentiments will not disappear when a vaccine is created, unless we demand more than liberal appeals for tolerance</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Let’s take the claim that the novel coronavirus was caused by a culturally peculiar fondness for eating pangolins. Though it is true that pangolin scales and meat are advertised as a sort of folk medicine in mainland China, statistics suggest the real key variable are the effects of globalisation, which have enriched the country’s business classes. Prices for the animal have <a href=\"https://qz.com/874854/chinas-insatiable-thirst-for-pangolin-scales-is-fed-by-an-international-black-market/\">climbed from $14 </a>a kilo in 1994 to more than $600 today, while illegal shipments confiscated at the border regularly <a href=\"https://www.traffic.org/publications/reports/the-global-trafficking-of-pangolins/\">exceed 10 tonnes</a>. Customers ordering wildlife often do so in order to flaunt their wealth or to celebrate a good day on the stock market, although they remain a minority: <a href=\"https://www.researchgate.net/figure/Cognition-types-and-frequency-analysis-of-Chinese-urban-residents-attitude-toward_tbl1_225329213\">most Chinese citizens</a> support strict limits, if not a ban, on wildlife consumption. Resurgent pangolin consumption is thus a result of economic liberalisation in China – which the US championed – not simply of traditional culture.</p> <p>It was <a href=\"https://nplusonemag.com/online-only/online-only/chinese-virus-world-market/\">these same economic forces</a> that also hastened the spread of the virus overseas. Wuhan, where the virus originated, originally served as a hub between coastal metropolises, such as Guangzhou and Shanghai, and inland China. Although considered a “second-tier” city, even Wuhan has been caught up in the latest phase of globalisation, as capital pursues cheaper land and labour markets inland. During February and March cases of the novel coronavirus illuminated economic linkages long hidden from view, such as Chinese investments into infrastructure in<a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/irans-strategic-partnership-with-china-lies-at-root-of-its-coronavirus-outbreak-11583940683\"> Qom, Iran</a> or the ties between Wuhan’s car parts industry and factories in<a href=\"https://hbr.org/2020/02/how-coronavirus-could-impact-the-global-supply-chain-by-mid-march\"> Serbia, South Korea</a> and<a href=\"https://www.autonews.com/china/webasto-halts-travel-china-after-2-employees-germany-contract-coronavirus\"> Germany</a>. The coronavirus may have first appeared in China, but the ensuing spread and crisis also belong to the global assemblages of commerce, tourism, and supply chains erected by powerful interests in the 21st century.</p> <p>The great irony of blaming some vague notion of Chinese culture is that the best responses to the pandemic have come from the ethnic Chinese majority governments of <a href=\"https://www.thenation.com/article/world/taiwan-who-coronavirus-china/\">Taiwan</a> (five deaths, 380 cases), Singapore (six/1,910), and Hong Kong (four/974). Yes, their responsible policies were due largely to the trauma of the 2003 Sars epidemic but also have to do with the history of robust welfare states in <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/01/opinion/covid-face-mask-shortage.html\">East Asia</a>, which, unlike Europe and the US, have increasingly invested in healthcare infrastructure to deal with precisely such crises.</p> <p>To push back on the anti-China line is not to apologise or defend the state’s actions. It is clear that local officials were wrong to silence <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/20/chinese-inquiry-exonerates-coronavirus-whistleblower-doctor-li-wenliang\">Dr Li Wenliang</a>, who alerted friends about the virus as early as possible, and that the government has consistently downplayed the virus’s contagiousness and the severity of deaths.</p> <p>But is the contrast between authoritarian and democratic regimes so stark, as<a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2020/02/why-democracies-are-better-fighting-outbreaks/606976/\"> western ideologues</a> allege? Most observers agree that China covered up the crisis in Wuhan for three weeks in January, and this lost time probably decided the difference between a local versus a global epidemic. Nevertheless, it is still sobering to read reports that even from mid-January other governments took even longer to respond: the UK dragged its feet for<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/mar/18/coronavirus-uk-expert-advice-wrong\"> an interminable eight weeks</a> and the US<a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/us-intelligence-reports-from-january-and-february-warned-about-a-likely-pandemic/2020/03/20/299d8cda-6ad5-11ea-b5f1-a5a804158597_story.html\"> ignored clear warning signs for 70 days</a>.</p> <p>This inactivity was partly the product of a western exceptionalism that believed viruses and epidemics only happen “over there”, in poor and non-white countries. This is a crucial point for challenging anti-Asian racism. Rather than debate the blame game, as Justice is Global director Tobita Chow has written, we should point out how short-sighted <a href=\"https://fellowtravelersblog.com/2020/04/03/policy-from-the-people-cooperation-in-the-face-of-covid-19/\">nationalist perspectives</a> have produced fatally ineffective responses. During Italy’s worst weeks, officials<a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/21/world/europe/italy-coronavirus-center-lessons.html\"> admitted they</a> initially viewed the Wuhan crisis as a “science-fiction movie that had nothing to do with us”. In the US, a<a href=\"https://www.kansascity.com/opinion/editorials/article241353836.html\"> Kansas politician stated</a> that his town was safe because it had only a few Chinese residents. In Philadelphia, in a more tragic offshoot of racial thinking, <a href=\"https://www.citylab.com/equity/2020/03/coronavirus-immunity-racism-history-disease-yellow-fever/607891/\">rumours circulated</a> that the virus could not infect black Americans because it was a Chinese disease, misinformation that officials now fear <a href=\"https://www.inquirer.com/news/philadelphia-coronavirus-race-african-american-cases-rising-20200403.html\">exacerbated inequalities</a>.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/apr/08/coronavirus-black-people-ethnic-minority-deaths-pandemic-inequality-afua-hirsch\">If coronavirus doesn\\'t discriminate, how come black people are bearing the brunt? | Afua Hirsch</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Ultimately, both the pandemic and the accompanying anti-Asian backlash are dynamics that go beyond questions of culture and xenophobia, carrying serious life-and-death consequences. Both are the indirect byproducts of China’s emergence as a major force in global capitalism, not only forging the supply chains and travel networks that conveyed the virus but also threatening Euro-America’s centuries-long economic and political prestige.</p> <p>In the US, such fears were already manifest in populist claims that China alone – and not the domestic political and business class – was to blame for the loss of manufacturing jobs. In the wake of a referendum result seen as a vote against globalisation, anxieties in the UK have recently been manifest in <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-britain-usa-huawei-instantview/reaction-to-uk-allowing-huawei-a-role-in-5g-network-idUSKBN1ZR1FU\">panic over Huawei</a> providing the country’s 5G network. Fears over China were not created by coronavirus, but find in it a most apt metaphor, as a global and invisible force of destruction.</p> <p>It follows that these dangerous sentiments will not automatically disappear when a vaccine is created, unless we demand more than liberal appeals for tolerance. We need to also recognise and confront the political-economic forces behind the west’s anti-China backlash – and the inadequacy of nationalism in responding to the social and public health crises facing us today, which are global in scale.</p> <p>• Andrew Liu is an assistant professor of history at Villanova University and the author of <a href=\"https://yalebooks.yale.edu/book/9780300243734/tea-war\">Tea War: A History of Capitalism in China and India</a></p> <p><br><br></p>',\n",

In Scotland, which also counts deaths outside hospitals, there were 48 more deaths making a total of 495. Wales recorded 29 more hospital deaths, taking its total to 315, and there were 10 more deaths in Northern Ireland, bringing its total to 92.</p> <p>The figures in England showed a particularly sharp rise in fatalities in the Midlands, where the number of victims rose by more than 84% from 124 to 229 in 24 hours.

All but 56 of them had underlying health conditions.</p> <p>The latest data came after it was confirmed that coronavirus had claimed the life of a 10th NHS doctor. Dr Fayez Ayache had retired as a Suffolk GP but had been working part-time in North Clacton, Essex, until three weeks ago. He had also volunteered to help refugees from his native Syria.

We are truly devastated and will miss him dearly. He was a true foundation in our lives.”</p> <p>Asked how many healthcare workers had died during the crisis at the daily Downing Street press briefing, Hancock passed the question to chief nursing officer Ruth May who said that internal numbers were available for nurses, midwives, healthcare assistants and doctors but that it would be “inappropriate for me to go into numbering them” without family permission.</p> <p>Like Ayache, all the other nine doctors to have been named as victims of coronavirus have been from BAME backgrounds.

There have been missiles and bullets, loved ones killed, and the fear of being conscripted into the army or tortured in Bashar al-Assad’s prisons.

It’s barely managing to eat. And now with the coronavirus some businessmen are capitalising on the panic and raising prices.” He asked that his real name not be used for fear of repercussions.</p> \\n<p>With Assad now <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jan/28/syrian-regime-captures-maarat-al-numan-in-idlib\">back in control of most of Syria</a>, the government should be focusing on the challenge of rebuilding a country it bombed into ruins while trying to drive out rebel forces and extremist groups. But since January the value of the Syrian pound – last year trading at 500 to the dollar – has dropped off a cliff, reaching a record low of 1,360 to the dollar on the black market in late March. As a result, inflation and the cost of basic goods are soaring. Even subsidised bread is sometimes unavailable as Damascus <a href=\"https://www.al-monitor.com/pulse/originals/2020/04/syria-regime-opposition-prices-wheat-crops-farmers-imports.html#ixzz6JCRm5IXx\">runs out of flour and wheat</a> reserves, relying on its Russian allies for emergency shipments.</p> \\n<p>According to a UN report from 2019, 83% of people across both government and rebel parts of the country were already living in poverty.

Price increases for food, fuel and transport have even sparked rare protests against the government in places such as Sweida, a city in the south-west populated mostly by members of the Druze minority sect that has remained nominally loyal to the government throughout the war.

       "   'body': '<p>The new shadow social care minister has called on the government to include fatalities from Covid-19 outside hospitals in its daily death toll, after the Guardian revealed that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/09/covid-19-hundreds-of-uk-care-home-deaths-not-added-to-official-toll\">hundreds of people had died from the virus in care homes</a> and not yet been counted.</p> <p>In a letter to the health secretary, Matt Hancock, Liz Kendall, who ran for the Labour leadership in 2015, said she had serious concerns that deaths of people in care homes were not being reported “in a timely manner”.</p> <p>The Guardian reported on Thursday that the industry body Care England estimated that the coronavirus death toll in care homes was likely to be close to 1,000, despite the only available <a href=\"https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/birthsdeathsandmarriages/deaths/bulletins/deathsregisteredweeklyinenglandandwalesprovisional/weekending27march2020\">official figure</a> being dramatically lower.</p> <p>Unlike hospital deaths, statistics for coronavirus fatalities in the community are only released weekly. The Office for National Statistics published figures for deaths in care homes for the first time on Tuesday, saying 20 people had died across the whole of England and Wales in the week to 27 March.</p> <p>That figure is 12 days behind the daily hospital death rate and relies on registered death certificates, which take an average of five days to process. With a time lag of around 17 days, social care operators say the scale of infection and fatalities is not being grasped.</p> <p>“This delay obscures the scale of the spread of Covid-19 in care homes and the impact on some of the most vulnerable people in our society,” wrote Kendall, who was appointed shadow minister for social care by the new Labour leader, Keir Starmer.</p> <p>“I therefore urge you to put in place a system where deaths relating to Covid-19 outside of hospital, including in care homes, are collected and reported regularly to the Department of Health and Social Care and published daily alongside deaths in hospitals.</p> <p>“For families and care staff, accurate and timely reporting of deaths of people in care homes is an essential step in tackling this problem and saving as many lives as possible. It will also enable the government to focus its efforts on ensuring all care staff get the PPE and testing they need.”</p> <p>Despite the low official figure, more than 120 residents of the UK’s largest charitable provider of care homes are thought to have died from the virus in the last three weeks, while another network of care homes is reported to have recorded 88 deaths.</p> <p>Care industry leaders and the Alzheimer’s Society told the Guardian that they believed the virus to be active in around half of care settings, which look after about 400,000 people in the UK. However, Prof Chris Whitty, the UK government’s chief medical officer, said on Tuesday that just over 9% of care homes had cases of Covid-19.</p>',\n",

       "   'body': '<p>For a week or so now, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/07/new-york-coronavirus-deaths-record-cases\">New York</a> has been at the centre of the coronavirus pandemic in the US, the<a href=\"https://news.sky.com/story/coronavirus-new-york-death-rate-highest-among-globally-comparable-regions-11969502\"> death rate in the city</a> headlined all over the world. For those of us who live here, the sense of worsening crisis – if we’re lucky – is measured in large internal fluctuations and small external ones.</p> <p>The <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/apr/03/comfort-ship-new-york-coronavirus-failure-symbol\">hospital ship</a> berthed 20 blocks south of my house is something I only see on the news. What has changed is more immediate. Things that even a week ago seemed necessary, including getting out every day for fresh air, now seem wanton. Our movements have become even more circumscribed. When we do go out, fully 90% of people on the street are in masks and our once-weekly trip to the store has changed. The panic buying phase is over, replaced by different fears. Yesterday, the supermarket was empty of people.</p> <p>At home, we lurch between wild optimism and gloom. It is a paradox of our present condition that, for many of us with young children, there is simultaneously no time and too much time. Whole days seem to pass in which I do nothing but stack and unstack the dishwasher, transitioning from work to home-school to dismantling the fort in the living room to collapsing into bed at 9pm. At the same time, not running a schedule has opened up a vast mental chasm, in which every assumption from before the outbreak is being tested. Why did we do it like that? And do we have to go back to doing it like that again?</p> <p>It’s hard to tell if any of these reckonings will last. I remember after my mum died, 15 years ago, thinking things will never be the same. In the first flush of grief, I was convinced I would value life more. None of the trivial stuff would matter. I would be kinder, braver, more grateful for sunlight on the garden – the whole nine yards.<br></p> <p>That lasted about three weeks. As the shock began to wear off, all I wanted was to return to my old life. I couldn’t remember what it felt like to see the world differently and I didn’t want to. There were no epiphanies: just the long, hard slog back to something approaching normality.</p> <p>For a lot of people, this period will entail real, personal grief as well as culture shock. But for those of us lucky enough to get through it without losing someone close, there will still be that period of grief-like readjustment, when for a second we will continue to see the world differently. It’s happening now, and somehow the more trivial the reckoning the more profound the sense of altered reality.<br></p> <p>Take laundry. Most New York apartment buildings have tiny communal laundry rooms where it’s impossible to enforce social distancing. So we’ve all stopped doing laundry, or at least stopped doing it every week. We’re not going out, so who cares. And why do we do it every week anyway? Getting the sodding laundry done was a huge weekly arse pain that has all but disappeared. We rewear clothes. We handwash in the sink. We don’t bother with the duvets. The sky hasn’t collapsed.<br></p> <p>The list of suspended obligations such as these is long and eye-opening: the abandonment of all non-hygiene-related personal grooming, particularly for women, points a big arrow to how time-consuming and expensive that bullshit was in the first place. The complete death of interest in celebrity comings and goings feels like cause for a national holiday. A lot of the things that seemed not only non-negotiable but desirable now don’t seem that way at all.</p> <p>The real luxuries are proving to be elsewhere. When the schools finally reopen I imagine that, in the first instance, having a working day without kids will seem unbelievably generous, even to 3pm when school ends. With this in mind, I can’t imagine going back to haemorrhaging a huge proportion of my income on after-school and summer camp programmes, just to win an extra three hours in my day. I’ll be more efficient. I’ll see more of my kids. If I make less, I’ll spend less. Everything will balance out.</p> <p>I have been here before. My instinct is these big resolutions won’t last. We’ll forget. The gravitational pull of business as usual will undo what felt like the most searing of insights. Finishing work mid-afternoon to run to pick up the kids will, after a few weeks, get harder, as the memory of working while being interrupted starts to fade. Perhaps another memory will remain; a more general sense of what it felt like to opt out of things we thought weren’t even optional; of asking ourselves if there were different ways to be.</p> <p>• Emma Brockes is a Guardian columnist</p>',\n",

       "   'body': '<p>Children’s TV and radio presenters are finding new ways to stop their audiences feeling stressed, following reports that young children are become increasingly anxious about the coronavirus pandemic.</p> <p>The BBC’s long-running Newsround programme has seen its audience rise substantially for its three daily broadcasts on the CBBC channel and <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/newsround\">its dedicated website</a>, with its reporters trying to find ways to provide optimistic takes on the news without sugarcoating the situation.</p> <p>“So many kids now have anxiety issues,” said Ricky Boleto, a presenter on the programme. “We’re letting kids know that we focus on what’s happening in their homes and gardens without making them feel they have to sort out the world’s problems … They’re sending questions such as ‘Is my grandmother going to die’? We’ve been trying to put them at ease.”</p> <p>He said children “have a very good moral compass, probably better than most adults” and Newsround aims to cover stories without patronising audiences: “The most important thing for us is to tell stories in a way that doesn’t presume knowledge, doesn’t patronise, and makes young people feel that this is their programme.”</p> <p>Plans to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2019/nov/16/bbc-plans-to-drop-afternoon-newsround-as-children-go-online\">cut the number of Newsround’s television broadcasts</a> and reallocate the budget on online content have also been put on hold due to the pandemic. Instead, the web team have focused on providing <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/newsround/51204456\">simple clear guides to the pandemic for children</a>. In the first week of the lockdown the Newsround website had 1.5 million unique visitors to its website, up 40%. It also offers the BBC a chance to prove its value to children and parents, especially as it faces a battle to retain the attention of kids once they reach the age of six or seven and they are tempted by YouTube and Netflix.</p> <p>The programme has seen an increased emphasis on asking children to submit their own material on how they are dealing with the lockdown while schools are closed: “There’s scary headlines elsewhere but Newsround is a safe space for kids to turn to while coronavirus changes everything about our lives. We try to be a positive platform as well and focus on what good is being done.”</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Callout callout-coronavirus\">  <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div data-callout-tagname=&quot;callout-coronavirus&quot;&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Callout&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;callout-coronavirus&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>Other changes are having to be made to children’s output. Amid the ongoing travel restrictions, the CBBC broom cupboard – the location where presenters introduce the next programme on the kids’ channel – has been transferred to presenters’ homes for the first time in 44 years. The BBC is also <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2020/apr/03/bbc-launches-daily-educational-shows-keep-children-studying\">preparing to launch an enormous range of educational programmes</a> from 20 April onwards.</p> <p>Matt Deegan, who runs the <a href=\"https://www.funkidslive.com/\">independent national children’s radio station Fun Kids</a>, said he has had to change the station’s output to reflect the new reality: “Our presenters refer to the fact that they’re broadcasting from home and talk about the positives and sometimes the negatives.”</p> <p>He has also launched a <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p087wy0l\">daily children’s podcast called Stuck at Home</a>, which has suggestions like using what’s in the recycling bin as as source for collages or creating Zoom quizzes for other family members. It has also become the first piece of content from a commercial radio station to be made available on BBC Sounds.</p> <p>Deegan said young children pick up on the severity of the situation: “I think there’s an awareness by them that parents think it’s serious and their sporadic anxiousness often gets eye rolls. The sheer volume of news drives parents to discuss things more openly than perhaps they normally would.”</p> <p>Boleto, the Newsround host, said explaining the news in simple terms for children was a real challenge: “Nick Robinson and Evan Davis have said that writing scripts for Newsround is harder than their day jobs. You have to go from the start, not presume any knowledge, and tell the story.”</p> <p>However, there is still space for some lightness on the show amid the pandemic gloom. He said: “We do still throw in the odd skateboarding dog and panda birth.”<br></p>',\n",

       "   'body': '<p>The European Union has scraped through its latest crisis by the skin of its teeth. The past week has been a disgrace. When <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/apr/09/eu-risks-break-up-over-coronabonds-row-warns-italian-pm\">ministerial talks</a> collapsed on Thursday over the plan for a “coronabond”, the reaction seemed terminal. Germans and Dutch insulted Italians and Spaniards. Italy’s prime minister, Giuseppe Conte, <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-52224838\">said his country faced</a> an “economic and social emergency”, and the EU appeared not to care. The Danes <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-52221259\">spoke of</a> “a financial crisis on steroids”. The European commission’s vice-president, Frans Timmermans, <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-52211650\">predicted</a> “the EU as we know it will not survive this”.</p> <p>Finally a last-minute package was agreed, for €500bn of emergency loan finance. This was little more than an extension of the existing European stability mechanism, designed to help individual countries in short-term emergencies. Even then, it was a mere third of what the European Central Bank had <a href=\"https://uk.reuters.com/article/uk-health-coronavirus-eurozone/ecb-urges-measures-worth-1-5-trillion-euros-this-year-to-tackle-virus-crisis-sources-idUKKBN21Q0U9\">said was needed</a>, €1.5tn euros. What was specifically not agreed was any sharing of the economic burden of the pandemic across European treasuries in general. It was mostly more loans.</p> <p>The reason was glaringly obvious, and as old as the EU itself. The northern European nations within the eurozone still do not trust the hard-pressed southern ones to spend money wisely and pay back their debts. It was the same reticence that governed the slow reaction to the 2008 financial crisis. In other words, the EU is not a true political union, like the United States or Russia or even the United Kingdom. When one EU country hits trouble, as Greece and Italy have done over Mediterranean migrants since 2015, the EU itself is silent. It turns its back and hopes trouble will go away.</p> <p>Political unions are specific things – a marriage of regions, provinces, states in one national unit – based on a sufficiency of shared identity and shared responsibility. When the US was created, it agreed to joint liability for federal bonds. When New Orleans <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/2010/aug/30/archive-katrina-batters-new-orleans-2005\">flooded in 2005</a>, Washington did not tell Louisiana it was on its own. Nor did Britain say that to Northern Ireland when the province collapsed into bloodshed in the 1970s. It has been pouring in money ever since.</p> <p>The Maastricht treaty of 1992 was based on an ambition to drive Europe towards just such a goal. That, and the subsequent Lisbon treaty of 2007, produced much bureaucratic infrastructure, ever wider “competences”, an executive presidency and an enhanced parliament – which, it was hoped, would convey consent to central authority. Crises like the present one are precisely what such a body should be able to handle.</p> <p>Yet as Britain showed at the time of Maastricht and since, Europe lacks that shared identity. It lacks accountable leadership to make consent effective. In 2008, Europe dragged itself behind emergency actions taken by Barack Obama in Washington and Gordon Brown in London. When the European Central Bank was galvanised into action, it did indeed “print money” through quantitative easing; but the easing was directly chiefly at underpinning German bank loans to Greece and others. It was banks that were rescued.</p> <p>This week it has been abundantly clear that many European governments simply do not trust the Italians and the Spanish to find a way out of the pandemic crisis responsibly. Italy is certainly in economic meltdown. Its system for getting cash into the pockets of poor Italians appears to have broken down. For the first time in 75 years, large numbers of Europeans are simply <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/29/italy-sets-aside-400m-for-food-vouchers-as-social-unrest-mounts\">unable to buy food</a>. Their erstwhile employers face bankruptcy, and their banks face collapse.</p> <p>Britain, outside the eurozone, can print money and hand it to employers – <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/apr/08/coronavirus-jobs-bailout-treasury-resolution-foundation-wage-subsidy-scheme\">apparently £40bn</a> if need be. That is classical monetarism, I assume to be tested to near destruction. It is sensible, and there is little likelihood of the cash dissipating into inflation. That option is not open to Italy. It has delegated it under treaty to the EU and its bank. It can only borrow, and Italy is already crippled with debt.</p> <p>Over the next fortnight, any hope of a truly concerted European response to coronavirus is implausible. The EU has so far been inert. Nation states have been forced back on their own science, and their own health resources. Borders have closed and suppressions varied, from total lockdown to none at all. An exasperated EU research council voted no confidence in its chief scientist, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/08/eu-most-senior-scientist-mauro-ferrari-resigns-handling-coronavirus-crisis\">Mauro Ferrari</a>, who resigned in a huff.</p> <p>It is clear that one country after another will soon be liberating its citizens from lockdown, even at some cost in extra deaths. As other Europeans see <a href=\"https://www.dw.com/en/coronavirus-what-are-the-lockdown-measures-across-europe/a-52905137\">Germans</a> and Scandinavians working, shopping and enjoying spring, the pressure on their governments to end the lockdown will be intense. Pressure will devolve on to health services, while wider economies will struggle to recover.</p> <p>The head of the International Monetary Fund <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-52236936\">says the world</a> is facing “the worst economic crisis since the Great Depression of the 1930s”. This surely is a time for the EU to show a capacity for leadership. It should use the opportunity to show its electorates, Europe-wide, that it can rise to the occasion and share responsibility across the board. Did not the founder of the EU, Jean Monnet, say that a new Europe “will be forged in crises”?</p> <p>Daily reports indicate that citizens across Europe are showing a collective concern and care for each other. The pandemic has revived a faith in local community, and in a shared sense of nationhood. Yet the reaction of key European governments to this financial emergency has been like that of the British people in 2016. They don’t trust the EU with their money. What you don’t trust with your money is not a union.</p> <p>• Simon Jenkins is a Guardian columnist<br></p>',\n",

There is a real danger that this is too little, too late, and there simply isn’t time to go cap in hand in weeks and months to come.”</p> <p>The National Care Forum, which represents not-for-profit providers, described its reaction as one of “dismay and disbelief”.</p> <p>Vic Rayner, the forum’s chief executive, said: “Local government runs the risk of pushing care providers into substantial failure and collapse by not stepping up to the mark at this time of national need.”</p> <p>The letter from the LGA and Adass sets out a framework for councils to negotiate local terms with providers they contract with for state-supported residents of care homes and people receiving homecare. It acknowledges that costs have risen because of the need to buy <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2020/apr/06/residential-homes-desperate-for-ppe-as-two-care-workers-die\">personal protective equipment (PPE) for care workers</a>, to cover for higher sickness absence and to increase staffing levels because of the greater level of dependence of people being cared for.</p> <p>It says that an initial review of evidence suggests that costs are likely to rise by 10% this month, but that some services – for example, support for people with a learning disability – “may be differently affected and may need a differing local solution”.</p> <p>The letter says: “There are many calls on the government grant of £1.6bn and whilst it was expected that a substantial part of it would be needed for adult social care, it would not be possible to sustain substantial temporary increases in funding to providers over a number of months without additional government resources.”</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Callout callout-coronavirus-tributes-and-memories\">  <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div data-callout-tagname=&quot;callout-coronavirus-tributes-and-memories&quot;&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Callout&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;callout-coronavirus-tributes-and-memories&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>Green said PPE supply was at the forefront of all care providers’ minds. “It is disappointing that the paltry increases proffered by the LGA would not even cover the costs of PPE – if, indeed, providers were able to procure sufficient supplies.”</p> <p>The Care Provider Alliance, an umbrella group of all 10 main national associations of providers, warned there was no guarantee that all councils would pay even the 10% increase. “We do not believe that there is a system in place to ensure that £1.6bn of public funds reaches frontline services.”</p> <p>Ian Hudspeth, chair of the LGA’s community wellbeing board, said providers would need to work closely with councils to win further funding. “Nobody can say for certain how this situation will develop and what further resources will be needed.”</p>',\n",

       "   'body': '<p>Sunbathing in the park, normally the most innocent of pleasures, is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/05/uk-sunbathers-stricter-coronavirus-lockdowns\">causing outrage</a>. The police are involved; the parks may be shut.</p> \\n<p>Lockdown is never easy, but when the weather is good, the urge to be outside, to feel the sun on your face, to lie on the grass, under a tree, is almost irresistible. To close your eyes and pretend just for a little while that life is normal. How can this be wrong?</p> \\n<p>Extreme libertarians think it is not. They say that freedom is so important that losing it is worse than death (other people’s deaths, at any rate). Most of us don’t agree. We accept the need for social distancing. But even so, the lockdown rules don’t require us to stay in all the time. There are exceptions. Why not just one more, just for me, my family, our suntan cream and picnic basket? If my local park is empty, my family and I can enjoy our picnic <em> </em>in the open air. We refresh ourselves and don’t harm anyone else – they chose to stay at home anyway. What could possibly be wrong with that?</p> \\n<p>Moral and political philosophers have long struggled with the conflict between individual choice and the common good, between general rules and exceptions, and have come to very different conclusions about the right answer.</p> \\n<p>It is plainly rational, game theorists say, to make some people better off (me and my family) and no one worse off (everyone else). Some moral philosophers have thought it morally right too. According to utilitarians, rules are made to be broken, when you make people happier by breaking them. Our fundamental moral duty, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2017/apr/03/john-stuart-mill-on-liberty-100-best-nonfiction-books-review-robert-mccrum\">John Stuart Mill</a> said, is to produce the greatest happiness of the greatest number. In the time of coronavirus, that means staying away from other people.</p> \\n<p>But if you can do that while making yourself happier – by sunbathing or picnicking, because everyone else has obeyed the lockdown – it is not just permitted but actually morally right to go for it. Of course, seeing my family reclining outdoors may send onlookers into a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/apr/06/lockdown-viral-trends-5g-towers-coronavirus-cases\">righteous fury</a>, reducing the total happiness (though righteous fury can be pretty enjoyable too). Also we may inspire others to break the rules themselves, and if everyone thinks this way, the park will be full. That is dangerous for us all and it would be better to stay at home. But all this means is that I ought to be discreet. If I am, no harm, no wrong.</p> \\n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"3849e921-99ee-4b30-87d9-ad45ffd298fb\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \\n  <div>\\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/tVoHlEfXtJ0?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\\n  </div>\\n </gu-atom> \\n</figure> \\n<p>Can that really be true? <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/belief/2013/sep/20/west-kantian-ideal-freedom-society-suffers\">Immanuel Kant</a> thought the fundamental moral question was a different one: what if everyone did that? Kant thought it was right to act only in ways that could be a universal law. We know that if everyone picnicked in the park, no one could do so safely. When I do it anyway, I am acting in a way that could not be for everyone. I am relying on everyone else abiding by the rules, exploiting their conformity to benefit myself. I am treating myself as an exception, a special case. This is not a way of treating other people with respect. This is not fair.</p> \\n<p>If we accept that morality is not only a matter of harm and benefit, but also respect and fairness, we can see what is wrong with picnicking in the park at the present time. But once we start to think in these terms, we need to look at a much broader picture. As political philosophers such as Karl Marx emphasise, our individual decisions are made against a social background that we have not chosen. Lockdown is a very different experience for different people, depending on their personality, their family circumstances and their living conditions. It is easier to stay at home in a large, roomy house with a pleasant garden than in a cramped high-rise flat with no outdoor space.</p> \\n<p>Lockdown <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/apr/09/coronavirus-inequality-managers-zoom-cleaners-offices\">reinforces existing social inequalities</a>. It is even less excusable for the more fortunate to break the rules. Though we should all keep to the guidelines, it doesn’t follow that we should heap blame on those who don’t, not knowing what staying at home is like for them, not knowing their reasons for being out. Of course they should comply, but be kind; most people are doing their best.</p> \\n<p>It is a mark of the crisis we are in that simply sunbathing in the park raises the deepest questions about what truly matters in our lives: the happiness of all, even if I rely on others obeying the rules, as utilitarians would say. Or respect and fairness, as Kant would reply. The role of individual responsibility within a social context, as Marx would insist.</p> \\n<p>Finally, we can draw on another value very important to Marx (and Rousseau and Hegel too): the value of solidarity. There are huge disparities between the burdens a few are being asked to bear for the sake of the many. Doctors, nurses and other key workers constantly risk their lives to look after the sick and to keep essential services running. For the rest of us, there is very little that we can do to make a difference in this global crisis. It is easy to feel helpless and overwhelmed. But in fact, sitting at home, we can stand in solidarity with those who are doing more. We are doing our part, and treating fairly everyone else who is doing the same. It is the most, and the least, we can do.</p> \\n<p>• Alison Hills is a fellow and tutor in philosophy at St John’s College, University of Oxford</p> \\n<p><br><br></p>',\n",

       "   'body': '<p>When will the pandemic end? The future is uncertain, but it seems likely that over the next 18 months the UK will experience a cycle of national lockdowns while it awaits a vaccine. This is far from ideal. Repeated lockdowns could lead to mass unemployment, rising national debt, uncontrolled bankruptcies and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/01/singing-stops-italy-fear-social-unrest-mount-coronavirus-lockdown\">widespread social unrest</a> as people grow sick of draconian measures. Many people are now asking how quickly the lockdown can be lifted – and how soon we can return to normal.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/apr/09/brexit-britain-economy-coronavirus-gdp-figures-economic-growth\">Brexit had already damaged Britain\\'s economy. Now coronavirus could sink it | Gaby Hinsliff</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Monitoring the <a href=\"https://www.healthline.com/health/r-nought-reproduction-number\">reproductive rate of infection figure</a>, R<sub>0</sub>, will be crucial to any decision about lifting the lockdown. The figure indicates how contagious an infection is. As the R<sub>0</sub> number drops below one, each existing infection causes less than one new infection; eventually, the outbreak will decline and die out. When R<sub>0</sub> remains steadily less than one, governments may decide to gradually loosen restrictions, with the lockdown relaxed earlier in lower intensity areas and later in hotspot cities such as London.</p> <p>New data <a href=\"https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(20)30746-7/fulltext\">published this week</a> in the Lancet, from a team of researchers at the University of Hong Kong led by the clinician Gabriel Leung, shows that the spread of infection in China outside Wuhan, measured by the R<sub>0</sub> in four major cities (Beijing, Shanghai, Shenzhen and Wenzhou) fell below one within two weeks of partial lockdown. This is good news; it shows a partial lockdown can quite quickly suppress transmission of the virus. Our national lockdown and social distancing measures may already have brought the R<sub>0</sub> down across much of the country.</p> <p>But the problem still remains of how to prevent a second surge. The Hong Kong researchers worry that as economic activity restarts, local and imported cases of coronavirus could lead to new outbreaks. And the R<sub>0</sub> rate varies across different regions: case fatality rates were just below 1% in Beijing, Shanghai, Shenzhen and Wenzhou compared with 5.9% in Wuhan. We will likely also see a higher rate of infection and death rate in London than the rest of the UK.</p> <p>Moreover there’s a crucial difference between the response to coronavirus in China and that in the UK. From the beginning of the outbreak, the Lancet researchers note, “only residents were allowed to enter residential communities, face mask-wearing was made compulsory, and non-essential community services were shut down”. Health authorities also <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/09/the-new-normal-chinas-excessive-coronavirus-public-monitoring-could-be-here-to-stay\">found cases</a>, traced contacts and isolated them, monitoring their quarantine closely.</p> <p>So it was not just a lockdown and social distancing that were responsible for bringing down the R<sub>0</sub> number in China, but the country’s community surveillance approach. Scarred by memories of the Sars outbreak in 2002, China and other east Asian states acted with greater speed, imposing total or partial lockdowns supported by a protective shield of community measures – finding people with the virus, isolating them swiftly, and tracing those they contacted.</p> <p>In South Korea, this took the form of mass testing and digital contact tracing; in Taiwan, Hong Kong and Vietnam, health authorities identified cases based on people’s symptoms, and used testing when available. Strict isolation of cases and contacts was monitored by phone apps and home visits. Rather than enforcing a one-size-fits-all approach, China varied the lockdown across different regions. While Wuhan was under <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/19/chinas-coronavirus-lockdown-strategy-brutal-but-effective\">total lockdown</a>, other provinces had more autonomy, and focused on quarantining the household clusters where most transmission took place.</p> <p>Data seems to show that this approach is the right one. Death rates in Asian countries have been lower than in the US and Europe (South Korea’s death rate, for example, is four per million and stable; the UK’s is 105 per million – and rising). In addition to helping reduce the R<sub>0</sub> number, a community shield may also allow governments to lift national lockdowns more quickly. Rather than maintaining a prolonged lockdown, governments can target measures at people who actually have coronavirus. This would likely be far less disruptive to the economy: better to quarantine 10% of people who have coronavirus symptoms than an entire population.</p> <p>At first, Britain eschewed the community shield approach. On 12 March the government stopped community testing and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/12/uk-moves-to-delay-phase-of-coronavirus-plan\">moved to a “delay” phase</a>, explaining that a managed spread of the virus across 60% of the population, with a case fatality rate around 1%, would hopefully produce <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/mar/15/epidemiologist-britain-herd-immunity-coronavirus-covid-19\">herd immunity</a> and allow the economy to move on. After its modellers realised this strategy would overwhelm the NHS, the government enforced a lockdown. It is now attempting to conduct 10,000 tests a day, mostly in hospitals for patients and health workers.</p> <p>Despite Britain’s slow start, there are reasons for hope. Behind the scenes, general practices and public health workers are working at tremendous speed to build our own protective shield. They’re finding places to treat infected patients who aren’t sick enough for hospital but can’t be nursed at home, visiting those with long-term conditions or coronavirus symptoms, and building a picture of community spread using 111 data. The UK should also be able to roll out contact tracing using the new <a href=\"https://www.digitalhealth.net/2020/03/nhsx-coronavirus-contact-tracking-app/\">NHSX app</a> and the popular <a href=\"https://covid.joinzoe.com/\">Zoe Covid symptom tracker</a>.</p> <p>We have four to six weeks to ramp up testing and build our community shield before we lift the lockdown. After this, we can then get most people back to work, focus on quarantining individual cases and contacts, and suppress outbreaks if they arise. Hopefully this approach will help us avoid further national lockdowns. But it will take a long time before life returns to normal.</p> <p>• Anthony Costello is professor of global health and sustainable development at University College London</p> <p><br></p>',\n",

       "   'body': '<p>My debut album, Geography, was a jolly, summery record, but when I made it I was going through a breakup, I was by myself a lot, it was summer and I was locked in the studio. It wasn’t very fun. But I’ve always managed to make feelgood music regardless of whether I’m feeling good – perhaps that’s set me in good stead for where we are now.</p> <p>I have been trying to achieve something every day, even if that is just a big cycle ride. I’ve been doing cover versions or jamming on the guitar, and putting them on YouTube. And I want to get into film scoring – I now have so much time, it’s something I want to work on as a craft. Maybe it’s because everything seems so dramatic right now that film scores sound so good.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c56t7upa8Bk\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/c56t7upa8Bk?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>So I’ve been listening to Hans Zimmer’s Inception soundtrack.

He is a studio legend – his live drums sound like samples – and I’m always trying to work out how he does his stuff. I get to the point where I don’t even realise how much I’m nerding out.

       "   'body': '<p>Before we went into lockdown, I was trying to persuade my mother to reduce her contact circle to five. It seems absurd, now that everyone of advanced age and comorbidities has been told to see no one at all, but way back then (three weeks ago), this seemed reasonable. She immediately bartered the number up to six. It was like negotiating with Tony Soprano: there was no way she was coming out of the deal without the upper hand. Then I asked her how she planned to tell the rest of her associates that they weren’t on the list, and she said: “Good heavens, I’m not going to <em>tell </em>them. That would be so rude!”</p> <p>Then the list was reduced to zero, but mysteriously, one of the original six went round anyway to fix her letterbox. I asked what was the point of fixing her letterbox, when the only important letter she was going to get <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/shortcuts/2020/mar/16/coronavirus-skype-lessons-and-exercise-plans-how-older-people-are-preparing-for-lockdown\">would be from the government, telling her not to have anyone round</a>, irrespective of whether or not she had a defective letterbox. She said she would prefer to have less advice, and be given a lethal injection. “I wouldn’t mind,” she said, graciously. “I”m not sure whether the main impediment to euthanasia is whether or not you mind,” I observed, extremely calmly and not at all sarcastically.</p> <p>My friend’s mum got a guy round to fix her cutlery drawer, which has been broken for two years. My sister’s neighbour, supposedly in full cocoon, still goes to the shop every day and, when she said she would go for him, he said: “I’m just in and out. It’s not like I’m asking anyone to dance.” Another cocoon-candidate in my life goes out before dawn every morning just to smell the sea, like the bloody French Lieutenant’s Woman. My uncle spent the night before the pubs closed in a Wetherspoon’s, which I disapprove of in 17 different ways. It is very annoying trying to get the people who should take this the most seriously to take it seriously at all. But it’s also sort of a duff judgment to make, because when you have a life-limiting condition, and even before this happened, you already felt like – in my mother’s words – a hot-air balloon with a terminal puncture, waiting to hit the ground, it is highly debatable and a completely personal matter whether you want to spend <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/22/which-conditions-mean-that-you-should-isolate-for-12-weeks\">12 of what is a finite number of weeks completely on your own</a>.</p> <p>Not everyone over 70 is in the same situation. For some, that “underlying health condition” means they wouldn’t even be admitted to hospital, nor want to be. It simply isn’t possible to adjudicate across the piece, from a distance, as if the elderly were one homogeneous mass.</p> <p>Yet we are all trying to build new rules, at speed, and the easiest way to do so is to constantly, volubly judge each other. Since the sun came out, it has been like a new season of censoriousness. In any normal year, the spaghetti straps would appear and society’s sap would start to rise. This year, it’s a super-charged indignation. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2020/mar/23/is-it-ok-to-shout-at-strangers-who-arent-social-distancing-absolutely\">Families are furious with joggers, cyclists are furious with bipeds</a>, everyone hates dog walkers, except anyone with a dog, who is wondering why dogless people have to be out at all. The usual great sunbather debate – regular human beings getting vitamin D, or spawn of Satan? (somebody get <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b006qk11/episodes/player\">The Moral Maze</a> on the case) – was less interesting to me than my own bugbear, people with huge gardens and/ or no clue what it’s like to live with a two-year-old and a four-year-old, waxing judgmental about why everyone couldn’t do the responsible thing and remain totally indoors, open a window if they felt so stir crazy. But I got my own comeuppance with that, when I launched full tilt into a fight on Twitter with one of the “just stay indoors” brigade, only to find that she was quarantined away from her own children, and had been for weeks, because she worked in a hospital. So yes, I was categorically the arsehole.</p> <p>All bets are off, and there are no shortcuts: you cannot possibly guess why that person is behaving the way they are, or saying the things they do. You can’t know what pressures they are under, or whether it was the same or better or worse yesterday. You can’t know what they think about their own mortality, or why. You can’t even know for sure what bubbling tensions are driving your own reactions, until you wake up at 5am, dreaming about Harriet Harman trying to save a sinking island through the medium of dance, and realise it’s possible you are more anxious than you thought. There is really no alternative but to put our own finger-pointing on ice, or under lockdown, if you prefer.</p> <p>My mother, incidentally, was right and there appears to be an unlimited number of people who wish they were on her list-of-zero. Someone left a bottle of rosé on her doorstep the other day, and she was worrying that she didn’t know who to thank. I said: “Put a giant sign on your door, saying, ‘Thanks for the rosé.’ That way, the person will feel thanked, and the whole street will know that you appreciate rosé.” I might be insensitive but I am also a stone cold genius.</p> <p>• Zoe Williams is a Guardian columnist</p> <p><br></p>',\n",

The government would also gain the ability to restrict freedom of movement and assembly, seize private property and enforce quarantines.</p> <p>In addition, a catch-all clause would authorise “other measures that are deemed appropriate and necessary in response to the state of emergency”.</p> <p>Hun Sen initially downplayed the threat of coronavirus, and at one point threatened to throw journalists out of press conferences if they wore masks. When the Westerdam cruise ship was turned away by several other countries concerned about the outbreak, Hun Sen not only allowed the ship to dock but attracted international attention by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/feb/16/woman-let-off-cruise-ship-in-cambodia-tests-positive-for-coronavirus\">hugging passengers as they disembarked</a>.</p> <p>The country, where a lack of media freedom means scrutiny is limited, has since recorded 115 cases of the virus. Schools and entertainment venues have been shut, and wider travel restrictions announced.</p> <p>The state of emergency could be invoked whenever the country is considered to be facing a great risk, such as in a pandemic, war or disruption to public order, according to the law.</p> <p>Anyone found guilty of disobeying emergency measures, which are vaguely worded and could be used to target government critics, faces 10 years in prison.</p> <p>David Griffiths, director of the office of the secretary-general at Amnesty International, described the legislation as indefensible. </p> <p>“This is a blatant exploitation of public panic around Covid-19 and threatens to eviscerate the human rights protections which are guaranteed by the Cambodian constitution and international human rights law,” he said.</p> <p>Independent journalists, government critics and people speaking about Covid-19 online are being arrested on a daily basis, he added. </p> <p>This week, Sovann Rithy, a journalist working for broadcaster TVFB, was arrested for quoting a recent speech by Hun Sen in which the prime minister said: “If motorbike-taxi drivers go bankrupt, sell your motorbikes for spending money. The government does not have the ability to help.” The police arrested Rithy, stating that Hun Sen’s words were intended as a joke.</p> <p>Griffiths said: “The idea of concentrating even more unchecked power into the hands of this government is worrying in the extreme.”</p> <p>Asean Parliamentarians for Human Rights (APHR), an association of members of parliament from south-east Asian countries, said similar laws are being used across the region to crack down on critics. </p> <p>This includes the Philippines, where individuals can be jailed for spreading false information about Covid-19, and Thailand, where an emergency decree allows the prime minister to censor publications for a broad range of reasons. Officials in Thailand also have additional powers to arrest and hold people without charge if they are suspected of having a role in causing an emergency.</p> <p>Thailand’s prime minister, Prayut Chan-o-cha, and Hun Sen, “have both shown in the past already creative ways to hang on to power”, said Teddy Baguilat, a former Philippines MP and board member of APHR. “We need to make sure that the Covid-19 pandemic does not become their new tool to further legitimise and secure their authoritarian leadership.”</p>',\n",

It also took issue with Hancock’s insistence that the NHS has enough PPE to go round but needs frontline staff to use “no more and no less” than they clinically require.</p> \\n<p>Dr Chaand Nagpaul, the BMA’s chair, said: “We are dealing with an unknown, highly infectious, and potentially deadly virus that has already claimed the lives of several healthcare workers, including 11 doctors in the UK.</p> \\n<p>“It is absurd that the people trained to treat this disease are the ones who are not being appropriately protected – and without them, we face real disaster.</p> \\n<p>“We note the government’s announcement this afternoon … However, PPE should not be a ‘precious resource’ and for NHS staff facing shortages of protection they need today, they don’t want to hear of a plan, but that this vital equipment is made available to the frontline now.”</p> \\n<p>Susan Masters, director of nursing at the Royal College of Nursing, also voiced scepticism that Hancock’s pledges would end the supply problems that are causing alarm among staff, and denied nurses were misusing PPE. <br><br>Masters said: “These figures on deliveries are only impressive when nursing staff stop contacting me to say what they need to use wasn’t available. The calls are still coming through – people are petrified. They have seen colleagues die already.<br><br>“Things have improved in recent days and I credit the government with that. But the safety of nurses and care staff must not be compromised. They are pretty clear about what they need to do to stay safe and they will be angered by any suggestion they cause shortages by misusing kit.”</p> \\n<p>As well as promising to tackle what he acknowledged was the “enormous challenge” of ensuring PPE reaches those who need it, Hancock said lab capacity had been increased sufficiently to allow any health or social care worker who needs it, to be tested.</p> \\n<p>He visited a newly opened “mega-lab” in Milton Keynes on Thursday and said 15 drive-through testing centres were available.</p> \\n<p>He stressed the complexities of meeting demand for PPE against the background of rocketing global demand, and without a significant domestic supply sector.</p> \\n<p>Diplomatic staff around the world have been pressed into service trying to source equipment, Hancock said, with Whitehall officials in London trying to organise transporting it to the UK.</p> \\n<p>He praised firms, including Burberry and Rolls-Royce, which have turned their facilities to manufacturing PPE – and urged others to do so, based on requirements published by the government. “If you’ve got production facilities, and you can meet our published specifications, we want to hear from you,” he said.</p> \\n<p>Appearing alongside Hancock, May underlined the toll, both physical and mental, that treating the virus is having on her frontline colleagues. But she said they were heartened by the public’s support. “The rainbows and NHS signs in the windows lift me, and they lift my colleagues,” she said.</p> \\n<p>She and Hancock emphasised the importance of the public continuing to use the NHS for conditions unrelated to the coronavirus.</p> \\n<p><br></p>',\n",

The hospital says the woman has been fit for discharge to specially adapted local authority accommodation, with a care package, since May 2019. It has twice tried to discharge her, but she has refused to cooperate.</p> \\n<p>She has a diagnosis of a functional neurological disorder and psychological conditions, including post-traumatic stress disorder, and a possible borderline personality disorder and Asperger’s syndrome. She needs helps with personal care, including washing, dressing and toileting, it was reported.</p> \\n<p>The hospital issued an urgent claim last week for possession of her bedroom on a 12-patient ward. One doctor said in evidence: “We are now in desperate need of beds for patients unwell with Covid-19 and all patients who are medically fit for discharge are being <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/19/29bn-provided-to-free-up-hospital-beds-for-coronavirus-patients\">discharged</a> home or into other care arrangements that are deemed safe, as per the government’s guidance.”</p> \\n<p>Her lawyer argued that MB did want to be discharged, but was concerned that the care package was inadequate owing to her complex needs, and that she would be at risk of suicide or self harm.</p> \\n<p>In his ruling, the judge said that although it was distressing for the woman, it was safe for her to be discharged into specially adapted accommodation, with 24-hour care provided seven days a week.</p> \\n<p>A UCLH spokesperson said: “Our staff have worked tirelessly with Camden council over a significant time period to ensure that our patient has a home to go to, with care suitable for her needs. UCLH welcomes the court’s judgment, particularly at a time when hospital resources are in such high demand.”</p>',\n",

English Heritage’s offering alone has gone from having a small dedicated following to almost 2m views since mid-March.</p> <p>“People are craving something different to watch I think,” said Hipperson. “They want to take their mind off the situation and try something new. I would definitely encourage people to try the recipes.”</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/mar/26/food-wholesalers-seek-help-over-unwanted-coronavirus-stockpile\">Food wholesalers seek help over unwanted produce</a> </p> </aside>  <p>English Heritage is not alone in seeing a surge in interest in online cookery demonstrations.</p> <p>Nearly 5.5 million people have this week watched Oprah Winfrey on her Instagram page <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/tv/B-nJfpgB8sb/?hl=en\">make spaghetti carbonara</a> “for the first time” after she watched Jamie Oliver on YouTube.</p> <p>On Thursday, Winfrey, in California, and Oliver, in Essex, teamed up for an Instagram live stream to make his Singapore-style fried rice together, a recipe made from using up scraps of veg and any bacon, sausage or frozen prawns you can find.</p> <p>Many chefs, stuck in their real kitchen rather than their work one, are also taking to Instagram. Sarit Packer and Itamar Srulovich, the founders of Honey &amp; Co, have started their #honeyandcoathome series from their south London home offering a flourless chocolate cake for Passover and <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/B-uk6IMDzPF/\">hot cross non-denominational buns</a>.</p> <p>Massimo Bottura, the Italian multiple-Michelin award winning chef, is livestreaming his family dinner prep every night. His <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/tv/B-kL9ZtIAoF/?hl=en\">toasted almond and saba ice cream with a pistachio sauce </a>is not exactly cupboard leftovers but still had more than 200,000 views.</p> <p>Food historian and writer <a href=\"https://angelaclutton.com/\">Angela Clutton</a> will on Saturday at 1pm be cooking lamb chops and veg from her kitchen as part of a daily <a href=\"https://www.timeout.com/london/news/borough-market-is-posting-live-cookery-lessons-on-instagram-032520\">Instagram live series created by Borough Market in London</a>.</p> <p>“There is a lot going on and people have been just so fast in putting these things together,” she said. “It’s because food is always such a great connector, it brings people together and somehow it is still managing to do that even when we can’t actually be together. I have to say I find it incredibly reassuring.”</p> <p>Crocombe was the real cook at <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2017/jul/19/ghost-stories-british-authors-imaginations-sarah-perry-mark-haddon\">Audley End House in Essex</a> between 1880 and 1884, serving Lord and Lady Braybrooke and their guests. Hipperson has been playing her for more than a decade, part of a team of interpreters putting on live demonstrations in the kitchens as well as the YouTube videos which have now taken off in such a big way.</p> <p>Hipperson said Crocombe had become a phenomenon in the same way people love Downton Abbey. “She was a real person, working in the kitchen, and people can relate to her … she’s not a monarch.</p> <p>“I make her as I imagine she would be, quite stern but clearly loving her work. She is quite joyful to watch I think. The fact that we are cooking real historical recipes is a factor too.”</p> <p>The recipes include hearty soups and ice cream made from staple ingredients. Others are a bit more of a performance.</p> <p>For example, <em>turbot à l’anglaise</em> sees Crocombe advising us to get a scullery maid to wash and pat dry the fish. She then rubs it with half a lemon, puts it in a turbot kettle and adds water.</p> <p>Once that’s on the heat, prepare a sauce with some butter, diced lobster and pounded roe and get a kitchen maid to push it through a sieve.</p> <p>Hipperson admitted US audiences “really did not like” the Victorian macaroni cheese recipe which is made from pasta, cheese, breadcrumbs and butter. “You couldn’t get much further away from mac and cheese.”</p> <p>Others are much more straightforward, said Hipperson, such as the <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lRI9LHBOpk0\">queen drop biscuits</a>, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XKPTUxoBw88\">cheese seftons</a> and, this weekend for Easter, saffron buns. “Some of them are trickier, like the apple dumplings, but they are just divine.”</p> <p>Avis Crocombe is one part of a much bigger <a href=\"https://www.english-heritage.org.uk/history-at-home/\">History at Home hub launched this week </a>by English Heritage, an online resource of videos, podcasts, articles and activity sheets.</p> <p>All its properties are closed but Matt Thompson, head collections curator, hopes the hub will provide distraction and comfort during the lockdown. “For me, it is a 21st-century cabinet of curiosities,” he said.</p> <p>“It is all in one place and we are planning new content.

Combine the flour, sugar, salt, egg and yeast together with enough milk to make a soft, but not sticky dough. Knead for 15-20 minutes and set aside in a warm place, covered with oiled plastic wrap or in a bowl with a cloth over until it has doubled in size (roughly 2-3 hours).</p> <p>Once the dough has risen, remove it and flatten it out slightly. Soak the saffron in the warm milk to get most of the colour out. You can then add add your other ingredients. Put the spices, lemon zest, lard, butter, saffron in its milk (which should now be yellow) and currants in the middle, fold it up, and knead again, folding and squeezing so that the new ingredients are well-incorporated (NB: these days you can also just put everything in a food mixer armed with a dough hook!). Cover again, and leave to double in size once more.</p> <p>Lightly grease two baking sheets and shape your dough into 12 equal buns. Round them off and leave in a covered bowl for 20 minutes to double in size once again.</p> <p>Whilst waiting, create a glaze with an egg, a pinch of salt, and 1 tbsp of milk. When ready, brush over each bun. Then, bake in the oven at 180c/350F for 15-20 minutes until each bun is golden brown. Serve on their own, or slathered with butter.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dzhQO46suYw\">A YouTube video of Mrs Crocombe making the saffron buns is available.</a></p> <p>• This article was amended on 13 April 2020 because an earlier version omitted a reference to when to add the butter in the method for the saffron buns recipe.

On Wednesday, 100 NGOs issued a <a href=\"https://www.hrw.org/news/2020/04/08/joint-civil-society-statement-european-governments-must-ensure-safe-and-timely\">joint statement</a> imploring European states to find new ways to help women access services during lockdown, such as through online consultations and, as introduced in the UK introduced last month, by allowing them to take abortion pills at home.</p> <p>In the US, the Center for Reproductive Rights <a href=\"https://reproductiverights.org/story/center-files-emergency-lawsuit-texas-protect-essential-abortion-access-during-pandemic\">has filed emergency lawsuits</a> in five states to thwart moves by legislators to ban abortion during the pandemic.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Callout callout-coronavirus\">  <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div data-callout-tagname=&quot;callout-coronavirus&quot;&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Callout&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;callout-coronavirus&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>“For us and for women who have unplanned pregnancies, it’s a very worrying time and [abortion] is time critical,” said Cooke.</p> <p>Last week, MSI <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2020/apr/03/coronavirus-crisis-may-deny-95-million-women-access-to-family-planning\">warned</a> that up 9.5 million women and girls would not access family planning services this year because of the pandemic, which could result in as many as 3m unintended pregnancies and 2.7m unsafe abortions.</p> <p>“It’s clear the majority of abortions are done in the first trimester, which makes them extremely safe. As countries go into lockdown or mobility is reduced, women will have to wait longer and the procedure becomes more complex,” said Cooke.</p> <p>“In the UK that’s one thing, where we have the infrastructure to deal with late terminations, but in many countries we operate in that’s not an option. Therefore it becomes critical and there’s a risk of unsafe abortion and complications.”</p> <p>He said abortion was “absolutely essential” to save lives. Unsafe abortionsaccount for between 4% and 13% of maternal deaths.</p> <p>Dr Jeanne Conry, president elect of the International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics, said </p> <p>“Abortion access is critical. Women need access or we will see more unintended pregnancies, more maternal mortality and more unsafe abortion,” said Conry.</p> <p>“Abortion is not an elective procedure, it’s an essential part of women’s healthcare.

Neighbouring al-Mahra province has closed its border with Hadhramaut, he added. Pictures of soldiers patrolling Ash Shihr’s empty streets were published by Yemeni media.</p> \\n<p>Health workers and aid agencies have been dreading the inevitable outbreak of Covid-19 in Yemen, where testing facilities are almost non-existent and the virus could have a uniquely dangerous impact.</p> \\n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"interactives/2020/03/interactive-coronavirus-live/totals\" data-atom-type=\"interactive\"> \\n  <div>\\n   default\\n  </div>\\n </gu-atom> \\n</figure> \\n<p>More than half of Yemen’s hospitals and clinics have been <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/18/health-workers-targeted-at-least-120-times-yemen-conflict\">destroyed or closed</a> during the bitter war between Houthi rebels, who control the capital Sana’a, and the Saudi- and Emirati-led coalition fighting to restore the exiled UN-backed government. The majority of attacks on civilian infrastructure have been carried out by the coalition, which is supported militarily by the UK, US and other western nations.</p> \\n<p>At least 80% of the 28-million-strong population is reliant on aid to survive in what the UN has called the world’s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2020/jan/07/yemen-heads-list-of-countries-facing-worst-humanitarian-disasters-in-2020\">worst humanitarian crisis</a>. Deep poverty, dire water shortages and a lack of adequate sanitation have already made Yemen a breeding ground for malnutrition and disease, most notably the worst cholera outbreaks <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2017/oct/12/yemen-cholera-outbreak-worst-in-history-1-million-cases-by-end-of-year\">in modern history</a>.</p> \\n<p>In an unprecedented step designed to show its awareness of the threat posed to Yemen by the pandemic, Riyadh began a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/09/saudi-arabia-begins-two-week-ceasefire-in-yemen-due-to-coronavirus\">unilateral two-week ceasefire</a> on humanitarian grounds on Thursday.</p> \\n<p>If it sticks, it would be the first nationwide halt to the fighting after several recent failed attempts, but the move has been met with scepticism by Houthi leaders. “We consider the ceasefire a political and media manoeuvre,” the Houthi spokesman Mohamed Abdel-Salam told Al Jazeera.</p> \\n<p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/26/clashing-uae-and-saudi-interests-are-keeping-the-yemen-conflict-alive\">Fierce fighting in al-Jawf governorate</a> between rebel forces and militias loyal to the government, which has displaced tens of thousands of people, has sporadically continued since the ceasefire was announced. A rival Houthi offer of a ceasefire is highly conditional, and appears to apply only to Saudi Arabia, and not the Yemeni government.</p> \\n<p>Martin Griffiths, the UN’s special envoy to Yemen, said on Friday that his office was in regular contact with both sides “on reaching agreements on a nationwide ceasefire, humanitarian and economic measures to alleviate the suffering of the Yemeni people”.</p> \\n<figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Callout callout-coronavirus\"> <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"<html><head></head><body><div data-callout-tagname=&quot;callout-coronavirus&quot;> <h2>Callout</h2> <p>callout-coronavirus</p> </div></body></html>\"></iframe> \\n</figure> \\n<p>The ceasefire announcement was cautiously welcomed by a consortium of more than 50 NGOs working in Yemen, including Oxfam, the Norwegian Refugee Council, Tearfund and the International Rescue Committee. “We urge all parties to the conflict in Yemen to immediately halt fighting, to implement a ceasefire on the ground without delay, to release all detainees and those forcibly disappeared, and to work with the UN special envoy to urgently restart comprehensive and inclusive political negotiations to end the conflict,” the group said.</p> \\n<p>Also on Friday, the UN’s World Food Programme said it was being forced to halve aid to Houthi-controlled Yemen because of a funding crisis.</p> \\n<p>The UN agency is feeding more than 12 million Yemenis a month, 80% of whom live in Houthi territory. From next week, deliveries will only reach families every other month, instead of monthly.</p> \\n<p>Some donors, including the US, have already cut funding to UN programmes in Yemen because of concerns aid has been diverted by Houthi authorities. Many aid workers have reported lengthy permit delays, harassment and detention as the rebels attempt to consolidate control over the management and distribution of resources.</p>',\n",

His <a href=\"https://robertjenrick.com/about-robert/\">website</a> says he lives with his family near Newark, his constituency in Nottingham, and London.</p> <p>The revelations also prompted a former Tory minister to accuse Jenrick of “arrogance”. But Jenrick defended his actions, saying he went to deliver food and medicine to his isolating parents. However, the Guardian understands his parents – who are aged 69 and 79 – were already receiving help from the local community, raising questions over the necessity of his trip.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-atom\"> <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"65a9450f-4bec-4555-bdb0-c829a2782b42\"         data-atom-type=\"guide\"    > </gu-atom> </figure>   <p>Asked whether he thought Jenrick was ignoring the government’s stay-at-home advice, Nick Thomas-Symonds, the shadow home secretary, told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme: “I think that’s for him to explain. As you know, the delivery of essential supplies like food and medicine to vulnerable people, vulnerable family members, would be permissible in the exceptions that there are for people to go outside.</p> <p>“But I think it’s very important now for public confidence that Robert Jenrick fully explains himself and why exactly that journey was necessary.”</p> <p>Downing Street defended Jenrick with a spokesman insisting the minister had complied with social distancing guidelines.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/09/why-even-cabinet-ministers-must-stay-home-in-lockdown\">Government instructions</a> say: “You should not be visiting family members who do not live in your home.” The only exception is if they need help, such as having shopping or medication dropped off.</p> <p>The former Tory minister Anna Soubry, who left the party in opposition to its stance on Brexit, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Anna_Soubry/status/1248509452426391558?s=20\">tweeted</a> on Friday morning: “The selfish arrogance of 2 trips #RobertJenrick telling cramped families in inner city high rises or squeezed suburban homes to #StayAtHome is bad enough but justifying it by asserting he didn’t break the rules is shameful. Snr Ministers must practise what they preach.”</p> <p>She added: “#RobertJenrick didn’t break #COVID-19 rules but he totally ignored his own instruction to #StayHome which he repeatedly said in media interviews &amp; from the No 10 podium. It smacks of arrogance. For some time many of us have said Govt messaging must be clear, consistent &amp; honest.”</p> <p>Steve Reed, Labour’s new communities spokesman, earlier <a href=\"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-8206255/Cabinet-minister-Robert-Jenrick-seen-visiting-parents-lockdown.html\">told the Daily Mail</a>: “MPs need to set an example to everyone about the importance of not moving around the country and if Robert Jenrick can’t provide a very good explanation as to why these trips were necessary then he needs to consider his position.”</p> <p>The row over Jenrick’s movements broke out after Scotland’s chief medical officer last week quit her post following intense criticism after she twice visited her second home. And it came amid ongoing questions over the whereabouts of Dominic Cummings, whose location Downing Street has repeatedly refused to clarify when asked this week.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Callout callout-coronavirus\">  <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div data-callout-tagname=&quot;callout-coronavirus&quot;&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Callout&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;callout-coronavirus&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>After the Guardian’s story on Jenrick was published, the minister <a href=\"https://twitter.com/RobertJenrick/status/1248341191738998787?s=20\">tweeted</a>: “For clarity – my parents asked me to deliver some essentials – including medicines. They are both self-isolating due to age and my father’s medical condition and I respected social distancing rules.”</p> <p>Defending moving to his Herefordshire property, he told the Mail that his family considered it the family home. </p> <p>Nearly three weeks ago the government published guidance warning people against all but essential travel, highlighting this “does not include visits to second homes” and that “people must remain in their primary residence”.</p> <p>Jenrick’s actions were defended by others, with Prof Paul Cosford, the emeritus medical director of Public Health England (PHE), suggesting it sounded like Jenrick had remained within the four “clear” guidelines by travelling 40 miles to deliver medicine and other essential items.</p> <p>“I can’t comment on Mr Jenrick. It sounds as if what he did was within one of the four guidelines to me, but others will obviously have to think about that more,” he said.</p> <p>Speaking at the daily No 10 lobby briefing, the prime minister’s spokesman said: “The secretary of state has set out in two different statements the reasons for the journeys that he made.</p> <p>“We are confident that he complied with the social distancing rules.”</p>',\n",

       "   'body': '<p>Since the coronavirus gripped Europe there has been one main theme to the emails pouring into the Guardian’s Consumer Champions column: why is my airline refusing to give me a refund?</p> <p>The rules are quite clear: if a flight is cancelled, the airline has to offer you a refund. The <a href=\"https://www.caa.co.uk/Passengers/Resolving-travel-problems/Delays-cancellations/Your-rights/Your-rights-when-you-fly/\">Civil Aviation Authority</a> states explicitly that “If your flight has been cancelled, your airline must offer you the choice of a refund or alternative flight.”</p> <p>But the airlines are trampling all over consumer law and the CAA appears to have abdicated responsibility for enforcing the rules.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2020/apr/08/reschedule-flights-get-refund-airlines-easyjet-coronavirus\">Why can\\'t we reschedule our flights or get a refund?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>As we <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2020/apr/08/reschedule-flights-get-refund-airlines-easyjet-coronavirus\">reported earlier in the week</a>, easyJet has removed its refund option from its website, obliging those who don’t want to reschedule to join the lengthy queue for the helpline.</p> <p>British Airways is no better. Its <a href=\"https://www.britishairways.com/en-gb/information/incident/coronavirus/latest-information?dr=&amp;dt=British%20Airways%20%7C%20Book%20Flights,%20Holidays,%20City%20Breaks%20%26%20Check%20In%20Online&amp;scheme=&amp;audience=travel&amp;CUSTSEG=&amp;GGLMember=&amp;ban=%7C%7CP1M%7C%7C%7C%7C%7C%7C%7CHOME%7C%7C%7C%7CL4%7C%7C%7C%7Canonymous-inspiration%7C%7C%7C&amp;KMtag=c&amp;KMver=1.0&amp;clickpage=HOME\">website</a> simply says: “If your flight has been cancelled you can rebook or claim a voucher online”, without any mention of your right to a refund.</p> <p>My brother has spent many hours fruitlessly trying to call the airline after it cancelled his £800 flight. There’s no way to email the airline, or even an address for post. It’s a matter of take the voucher – or wait endlessly in a call queue.</p> <p>Meanwhile, Ryanair bluntly says it cannot process refunds until the pandemic has subsided, and the best that passengers can hope for, right now, is a voucher valid for 12 months.</p> <p>Cue fury all round? Yes, people are right to be utterly frustrated at this behaviour and the denial of their rights.</p> <p>Yet I have a smidgen of sympathy for the airlines. They are on the peg for huge lease costs on now-grounded planes and are still paying a large chunk of staff costs. They are heading for losses of $252bn (£202bn) should the lockdown last three months, says the International Air Transport Association (Iata). Realistically, how are they going to cash-flow billions of pounds in refunds? It’s not a surprise they are sticking their fingers in their ears and not picking up the phones.</p> <p>Is there a halfway house, a solution that might satisfy the majority of people yet not permanently erode consumer rights?</p> <p>The big problem with vouchers is the restrictions around their use. BA, Ryanair and easyJet say they are valid for 12 months only. Why? What if you don’t plan another journey on a route served by that airline in the next year?</p> <p>Irish airline Aer Lingus has got it mostly right. Firstly, it has offered travellers a <a href=\"https://www.aerlingus.com/support/forms/voucher-refund-request-form/\">10% bonus</a> if they apply for a voucher; if you paid £100 for your flight, you’ll get a voucher worth £110.</p> <p>Secondly, it lasts five years, not one. Aer Lingus is part of the same company, IAG, as British Airways, so it’s a mystery why BA is not making the same offer.</p> <p>Thirdly, vouchers need to be fully transferable to other individuals without penalty. So if my brother were to accept a voucher for his cancelled £800 flight, he’d get a £880 voucher that I or someone else will happily pay him £800 for. It’s win-win-win. My brother gets his money back, I get a discount ticket, and the airline does not have to cash-flow a refund.</p> <p>I was asked to volunteer to come off an overbooked £250 BA flight from London to Bangkok in 1997. It offered me a £400 voucher, an overnight hotel at Heathrow and a definite seat the next day. The voucher had no expiry, and six years later I used it during a BA sale to buy two return tickets to New York. It was a total bargain. Vouchers really can work.</p> <p>The banks and credit card companies have offered coronavirus victims payment holidays. In a sense, opting for vouchers is giving a payment holiday to an airline while the business is in an almost impossible financial position.</p> <p>But if we do let the airlines go down this route, it should be time limited, and the usual rules reinstated when normal life resumes.</p> <p>It’s certainly better than a taxpayer-funded bailout, which is what the airlines will demand if their cash runs out.</p> <p>But I write this working from home in an attic room. One of the few joys from the ghastly virus is to look up to a sky brilliantly free from vapour trails. Maybe once the issue of refunds is sorted, the question that will be ever more pressing is whether we should be flying so much anyway.</p>',\n",

We hope to have more than 10,000 parents and carers across the UK complete the new online survey. Their responses will help us really understand how families are coping and what support could make all the difference to children, young people and their families at this time.”</p> <p>Wendy Minhinnett, who leads a support group for parents of young people who struggle with mental health difficulties, said many parents were struggling. “People are feeling really, really isolated and alone. When you are supporting a child with mental health issues, that puts extra pressure on you.”</p> <p>She said families where grandparents normally played a key role but no longer could because of the lockdown had been severely affected, as had families with children diagnosed with autism whose routines had been entirely disrupted.</p> <p>“One parent said, ‘My son will not let me go anywhere because he is so frightened of me catching something’.

       "   'body': '<p>Scottish fishermen are turning to food banks and welfare organisations, as the coronavirus crisis has led to plummeting demand for seafood, leaving many unable to work to feed their families.</p> <p>Worst-hit are lobster and crab fishermen in Scotland’s south-east and west coasts, according to the Fishermen’s Mission, a Christian welfare charity. Staff at the charity have also identified “pockets of need” in Shetland and as far south as Newlyn in Cornwall. This comes just before the Easter holiday, traditionally a period of increased demand.</p> <p>Claire McIntosh, the Mission’s area official for south-east Scotland, has been working 12-hour days fielding calls from crews whose skippers have had to tie up their boats.</p> <p>“I’ve been liaising with food banks since January,” said McIntosh, whose patch covers the 80 miles of coastline from Seahouses in Northumberland to Port Seton in East Lothian. “This is on the back of poor weather and poor catches during winter. They are very self-sufficient folk, very resilient, resourceful and hard-working. Their last resort is to come to us. But I’ve handed out £17,500 in the last few weeks, compared to £12,000 for the whole of the last year.”</p> <p>The UK fishing industry is worth £989m annually, with Scottish vessels responsible for more than half, at £574m in 2018. More than 70% of its catch is exported, mainly to Europe and Asia, but foreign and hospitality markets have collapsed in the crisis. While a much smaller retail market still exists for some fish, many supermarkets have shut their fish counters, reducing demand further. For high-value shellfish, the market is now virtually nonexistent.</p> <p>“Langoustine, shrimp and prawn are almost impossible to get rid of and the demand for crab and lobster in China has just vaporised,” said David Dickens, the Mission’s chief executive. “When there’s a pandemic, people aren’t interested in high quality seafood.”</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/apr/01/one-seafarer-almost-cried-the-last-chaplain-visiting-quarantined-boats\">‘One seafarer almost cried’: the last chaplain visiting quarantined boats</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The charity’s 71 staff across the UK are expecting things to get worse.</p> <p>“All the indications are we’re at the beginning of a curve of need,” said Dickens. “This is the calm before the storm. From Kirkcudbright in the south up as far as Mallaig, there’s a lot of very worried people. We’re planning for the worst, but hoping for the best. Our focus is keeping the lights on and keeping food on the table.”</p> <p>On 25 March, the Scottish government announced a £5m assistance package aimed at 650 seafood companies impacted by the collapse in the market for shellfish, and for owners of full-time registered vessels under 12 metres.</p> <p>Dickens welcomes <a href=\"https://www.gov.scot/news/support-for-seafood-fishing-industry/\">the scheme,</a> which is underway, but said he and his staff are supporting crew or skippers who are ineligible, including those working part time.</p> <p>A further £10m package for fish processing businesses was announced by the Scottish government on 3 April. A spokesperson said: “Work on the grant to processors is ongoing and we hope to open applications soon.”</p> <p>They added that further support is being made available, including a £2.2bn grant to help Scottish businesses pay staff and treat them fairly.</p> <p>Donna Fordyce, the interim head of trade marketing body Seafood Scotland, which is working on exploring other alternatives to get Scotland’s seafood to consumers, said: “It’s a pretty grim picture across the board. The seafood sector has been one of the hardest hit of all the sectors in Scotland, because of the level of exports. The market has more or less collapsed in Europe.”</p> <p>It was already a bad year for fishermen, she said, with the “worst weather we’ve seen for 15 years for fleets”, before the Covid-19 crisis hit.</p> <p>“The prawn and the scallop fleet are more or less all tied up,” said Fordyce. “The whitefish fleet, some are still going out.</p> <p>“It is going to be a UK market for the next few months.”</p> <p>Scotland has <a href=\"https://www.gov.scot/news/scottish-sea-fisheries-statistics-2018/\">2,089 registered vessels and 4,860 crew</a>. </p> <p>Among those waiting to find out if they are eligible for the £10m fund for processors is Jamie McMillan, the managing director of Loch Fyne Langoustines and Loch Fyne Seafarms. McMillan, who employs 22 staff directly and a further 48 on vessels, was forced to close temporarily three weeks ago because of the pandemic.</p> <p>“We are waiting with bated breath,” said McMillan, who processes and exports scallops, lobsters and crabs. “If we can’t get that or we are not eligible, we’re finished.”</p> <p>McMillan is currently paying his staff 80% of their salary, under the coronavirus retention scheme, which he can claim back from the government. But he lost 44% of sales to Hong Kong and China when Covid-19 first hit there, and has been losing money since January.</p> <p>“We are having to pay staff weekly. It’s a huge strain on the business as we haven’t any cash.”</p> <p>Based in Tarbert, Argyll and Bute, which has a population of 1,500, McMillan is one of the village’s largest employers.</p> <p>“Twenty-two jobs is a lot of families,” McMillan said.</p> <p>“The whole fishing industry is going to look different when we come out of this. Our customers in Hong Kong are saying 50% of their restaurants have not survived.”</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Callout callout-coronavirus\">  <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div data-callout-tagname=&quot;callout-coronavirus&quot;&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Callout&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;callout-coronavirus&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>Selling direct to the public, a tactic used by some shellfish fishermen in Devon and Cornwall, is more challenging in remote communities in Scotland, he said.</p> <p>“Everyone is trying to sell to the general public but for us it’s very precarious. Businesses like ours depend on volume. I see people in Cornwall doing that. But when you live remotely as we do, there is just not the demand.”</p>',\n",

His thoughts are with those affected by this terrible disease.”</p> \\n<p>Matt Hancock, the health secretary, told the daily briefing that Johnson’s condition continued to improve. “He wants to personally thank the whole clinical team at St Thomas’ for the incredible care he has received,” Hancock said.</p> \\n<p>The updates came after the prime minister’s father, Stanley, spoke of the improvement in his son’s condition, saying he was “amazingly thankful” for the efforts of the NHS and appreciative of the nation’s outpouring of support.</p> \\n<p>But he insisted his son – <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global/2020/apr/09/boris-johnson-moved-from-intensive-care-but-stays-in-hospital\">who is still being treated</a> at St Thomas’ hospital in London – must rest, warning that he cannot get “straight back to Downing Street and pick up the reins”.</p> \\n<p>He added: “To use that American expression, he almost took one for the team.

They said that there’s going to be a series of more flights. They’re saying there are up to 20,000 people who want to come home.”</p> <p>He added that MPs on the call raised the issue of the “lack of faith” in PIA to deliver further flights after constituents paid out thousands of pounds for tickets on flights that were cancelled. But he was told that charter flights would be difficult. “They felt the issues were going to be that the Pakistan government were not going to open the international airspace to obviously allow charter flights to take place.

       "   'body': '<p>Helen Simmons, a 28-year-old film producer from London, went into labour with her second child on the evening of 30 March – exactly a week after Boris Johnson announced a nationwide lockdown. “It felt like a 1960s-style birth,” she jokes.</p> <p>She arrived at the Royal Free hospital with her husband, Charles, at 5.30am the following day. “We were hoping for the best,” Simmons says. Instead, Charles was sent home because of new visitor restrictions brought about by the outbreak, and Simmons was sent to a labour ward on her own. She was hungry – she hadn’t brought enough food with her – so Charles dropped some off and stayed with her for a few hours before being ordered to leave again.</p> <p>For the next 10 hours, Simmons was in labour alone and Charles was relegated to a waiting room outside, like a Mad Men-era husband. It was tough. “The hardest bit of labour isn’t the pushing,” Simmons says. “It’s the contractions. And doing that alone … you don’t realise you need your partner so much, emotionally and physically, until you can’t have that person there with you.”</p> <p>After a 30-hour labour, the majority of that time spent alone, their daughter, Isla, was born on 1 April at 4.40am. Charles was allowed in to watch Isla being born before being ushered out. It certainly wasn’t the birth they had hoped for or planned. Yet Simmons feels the experience meant she discovered an inner strength she hadn’t known she had. “It gave me a newfound respect for women through history,” she says.</p> <p>As the coronavirus pandemic continues, pregnant women across the country will be wondering how it will affect them. “It’s an anxious time for pregnant women,” says Maria Booker of the charity Birthrights. “They are concerned about whether their partner can stay with them or what the birth will be like.”</p> <p>At the moment, according to official guidance, no British woman should have to give birth alone. “Visiting is restricted to help stop the spread of coronavirus,” says NHS England, “but our guidance is absolutely clear that a specific exception should be made for birthing partners when a woman is in labour.” The Royal College of Midwives (RCM) guidelines state that partners may not be able to accompany women during their induction and the early stages of labour because of physical distancing guidelines. But it adds: “At the point you go into active labour, you will be moved to your own room and your birth partner will be able to join you.” Provided, of course, they are not showing any signs of illness. No visitors are allowed post-birth.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"2765a9f42c32ea2fce86cee0a835aac70f785180\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2765a9f42c32ea2fce86cee0a835aac70f785180/0_19_1024_614/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Naomi Edmondson after the birth.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Naomi Edmondson after the birth.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Provided by Naomi Edmondson</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>But there is a degree of confusion about how the rules are being enforced by different trusts. Simmons spent most of her labour alone, but others have partners with them throughout. A business owner from London, Naomi Edmondson, 29, gave birth to a baby boy at St Mary’s hospital in Paddington on 31 March. Her husband, Ally, was allowed to stay with her throughout her planned C-section.</p> <p>What may be noticeable to mothers giving birth, however, is that hospitals seem emptier. A recent survey by the RCM found that 20% of midwife roles <a href=\"https://www.rcm.org.uk/media-releases/2020/march/rcm-plea-help-us-deliver-safe-care-for-pregnant-women/\">are currently unfilled</a> because of self-isolation, coronavirus or existing staff shortages. Last week, Lynsay Coventry, 54, died at the Princess Alexandra hospital in Harlow, Essex. She was the first midwife to die of Covid-19, showing the risks healthcare professionals are taking when carrying out their jobs.</p> <p>Emily Botelho, a 30-year-old artist from Manchester, delivered a baby boy safely on 30 March. Her partner, Richard, was allowed to be by her side. But afterwards, she overheard the midwives on her hospital ward discussing the staff shortages. “There was a bit of chatter about one of the maternity wards possibly having to close, as the staff were off sick and self-isolating,” she says.</p> <p>Many trusts are cancelling home and water births because they require more staff. However, Booker says: “We’d ask that trusts think carefully before pulling their home birth services.” She urges them to think creatively about how to work around staff shortages; some trusts are using private ambulances to serve their home birth teams, to take the pressure off NHS ambulance crews.</p> <p>Martha San, a 30-year-old personal assistant from London, found out through Facebook that her planned home birth had been cancelled because of a shortage of ambulances. Her midwife had planned to call her, but the news broke online first. San had postnatal depression after her first pregnancy, and had planned a home birth to minimise the chances of her mental health deteriorating. “The idea was to have the baby in an environment I felt comfortable in,” she says.</p> <p>When it came to it, “the birth was great”, says San. Her husband, Jamie, was by her side and baby River arrived safely on 29 March at Lewisham hospital in south London. “The fact I was not at home didn’t matter.” But doctors wanted to keep River in for tests and so San had to spend two nights in hospital alone because Jamie had been sent home. Her ward was noisy, and she couldn’t sleep. At 2am on the second night, San broke down. “I started shouting at the midwives and crying,” San says. “I said that I wasn’t meant to be there, this hadn’t been the plan, I shouldn’t be left alone with the baby and I wasn’t coping.”</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"83df0cf3ce87d3793000cf3f3bb0662124a60507\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/83df0cf3ce87d3793000cf3f3bb0662124a60507/0_0_1296_778/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Martha San with husband, Jamie, and baby River.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Martha San with husband, Jamie, and baby River.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Provided by Martha San</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>A midwife moved San to an empty ward so she could get some sleep, and looked after River for a few hours. They were discharged the next morning. But having to spend two nights in hospital alone with a newborn baby was distressing. “It just felt really wrong,” San says. “After the birth, I needed someone there and I didn’t have anyone.”</p> <p>Coronavirus also threw Rachael Collier-Thomas’s birth plans out of the window. The 38-year-old mother from Hertfordshire had planned to have a water birth, but it was cancelled. “When they told me I couldn’t have my water birth, I joked that I’d rather give birth to the baby at home than in a labour ward,” Collier-Thomas says. “But I didn’t actually expect that to happen.”</p> <p>When her waters broke on 24 March, the contractions were so mild that she carried on pottering at home. “I thought I could be like that for days.” A few hours later, Collier-Thomas felt an urge to push. “I thought: it can’t be the baby – it’s too early,” she says. “I haven’t even called the hospital.”</p> <p>Collier-Thomas delivered her daughter, Lottie, on her (formerly) white sofa, with the help of a local doula who had raced around. She is adamant that she didn’t seriously plan to have her daughter at home. “I know that home births can be dangerous,” Collier-Thomas says. “But maybe, subconsciously, I thought: ‘I really don’t want to have my baby on the labour ward.’” Collier-Thomas is not alone: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2020/apr/05/expectant-mothers-turn-to-freebirthing-after-home-births-cancelled\">as a result of the coronavirus lockdown</a>, other British women are turning to freebirthing, giving birth without any medical support. Some are concerned about the risk of contracting coronavirus in hospital; others have had their planned home births cancelled, and prefer to go it alone, without even midwives on hand. But having your baby at home, without medical supervision, can lead to a greater risk of complications.</p> <p>All the women I spoke to understand the pressures the NHS is under – and are not bitter that their births didn’t go as planned. “It’s hard to be upset,” says Simmons, when your own birth does not go to plan “because there’s so much going on. I totally get it.” Even though San’s hospital stay was upsetting, she has nothing but praise for the midwives doing their best under such difficult circumstances. “They were doing an incredible job,” she says. “But they can’t play the role of midwife and birth partner to every woman on the ward.”</p> <p>The strangeness of giving birth during a pandemic doesn’t end when you get home, though. Given the lockdown, many families won’t meet newborn arrivals for weeks, if not months. Helena (not her real name), a 25-year-old teacher from Edinburgh, gave birth to her first child at Edinburgh Royal Infirmary on 24 March. “The staff were brilliant,” she says. “Calm and supportive.” But not being able to rely on family or friends for childcare is tough. “We’re first-time parents trying to figure it out, without family for support,” she adds. “It’s stressful and overwhelming.”</p> <p>For some, coronavirus has cast a shadow over a joyful time. “It’s really tainted everything,” says Chloe Goodman, 38, a solicitor from Macclesfield. She gave birth to her daughter, Clara, on 20 March. Goodman describes the care she received at Macclesfield district general hospital as “brilliant”. But she feels upset Clara won’t meet her grandparents for months. “They’re only tiny for such a short period of time,” Goodman says. “They change so quickly.” Helena is also finding things strange. “I should be showing my baby off and going out and seeing people. But, instead, I’m sitting at home, feeling scared.”</p> <p>Many expectant mothers may be contemplating their births with trepidation. And the whisper networks of expecting-mum WhatsApp and Facebook groups can be frightening. “I’d been freaking out before the birth and imagining the worst,” says Edmondson. “But actually being in the hospital was the least worrying part of it all.”</p> <p>Edmondson urges women to ignore the rumour mill, and trust the NHS. “In the hospital, it’s not as bad as everyone says,” she adds. “For me, it was calm, and when you have your baby you’re in this lovely bubble. You’re not paying attention to all the scary stuff people are posting on social media.”</p>',\n",

There he encountered a strange mermaid-like creature. “I am Amabie who lives in the sea,” it said. “For the next six years, there will be abundant crops across the land, but there will also be epidemics. Show my picture to people as soon as you can.” Then Amabie was gone.</p> <p>The story circulated in newspapers – as did copycat sightings, including one of a land-based, ape-like version in 1876.Later depictions included, notably, Shigeru Mizuki’s ghosts and ghouls-filled manga <em>GeGeGe no Kitaro </em>(1960-69).</p> <p>Though Mizuki passed away in 2015, his <a href=\"https://twitter.com/mizukipro/status/1239818518536704001\">production company tweeted his drawing of Amabie</a> on 17 March, with the words: “May the modern epidemic disappear.”</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"7759a26de2036920bf97b1186c9cb4399f358f65\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7759a26de2036920bf97b1186c9cb4399f358f65/0_161_4032_2418/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A noodle Amabie mascot created from chikuwa (tubular fish ‘sausage’) rising from a bowl of udon noodles.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A noodle Amabie mascot created from <em>chikuwa</em> (tubular fish ‘sausage’) rising from a bowl of <em>udon</em> noodles.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: OKP Design</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Wishful thinking maybe, but that one tweet sparked Twitter hashtags such as #amabiechallenge and #amabieforeveryone. While some users, including manga artists such as Mari Okazaki, have been sharing <a href=\"https://twitter.com/cafemari/status/1241697999731822592\">paintings and drawings of Amabie</a>, other Twitter users have been more creative, posting pictures of embroidery, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/udonnoww/status/1243005039938953217\">bowls of </a><em><a href=\"https://twitter.com/udonnoww/status/1243005039938953217\">udon</a> </em>(thick wheat noodles) and <a href=\"https://friday.kodansha.co.jp/article/103565\">bento</a><em><a href=\"https://friday.kodansha.co.jp/article/103565\"> </a></em><a href=\"https://friday.kodansha.co.jp/article/103565\">lunchboxes</a> all inspired by the apparition. Some have even dressed themselves (and their pets) up like Amabie and tweeted the photos alongside their own hopeful messages. And now Japan’s Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare has enlisted Amabie for <a href=\"https://twitter.com/MHLWitter/status/1248143633225666562\">an awareness flyer it tweeted</a>, urging people to “stop the spread of infection.”</p> <p>The hope — and sometimes humour — that accompanies each depiction is real, and Amabie has become a unifying force that has Japan reaching deep into its own obscure past to find solace in uncertain times.<br></p>',\n",

This Covid-19 crisis focuses our minds on where priorities really lie; the NHS will undoubtedly emerge as a frontrunner.</p> <p>We need to spend on “national defence” because that is a prime responsibility of government, but it should be commensurate with our national income and with the real threats facing our nation.</p> <p>In that light, one has to question whether spending between £2bn and £3bn per year (actual government figures are hard to come by) on maintaining a Trident submarine on constant nuclear deterrent patrol at sea – when the missiles are not targeted and have been at “several days’ notice to fire” for over 20 years for lack of any perceived nuclear threat – is now a proper use of our rapidly vanishing national financial resources.</p> <p>This is on top of some £60bn-plus to replace the submarines, their missiles and other assorted costs associated with Trident.<br><strong>Cmdr Robert Forsyth RN (Ret’d)</strong><br><em>Former executive officer of a Polaris submarine and nuclear submarine commanding officer</em><br><strong>Cmdr Robert Green RN (Ret’d)</strong><br><em>Former Fleet Air Arm nuclear-armed aircraft bombardier-navigator</em></p> <p>• George Monbiot deserves a prize for his article – such clear common sense.

href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/jonathanjonesblog/2009/jul/28/antonello-da-messina-renaissance-art\">Antonello</a> was one of the first Italian artists to explore the subtlety of oil paints, which he learned about from Flemish paintings that made their way to the court of Naples. Here he uses that refined skill to paint a very human, vulnerable Christ whose agony on the cross is all the more touching for being realistic, without the gore and horror of medieval art. Antonello anticipates Michelangelo in making us feel an almost sensual compassion for Jesus.

       "   'body': '<p>You would think that, during the Covid-19 crisis, doctors are at a premium and are being snapped up with open arms by the NHS. Unfortunately, that seems not to be the case. I am a UK- and NHS-trained doctor, and for the past six years I have worked as a senior emergency medicine doctor in the NHS. I am also an NHS-qualified GP. Since mid-January I have been working as a civilian doctor for the Ministry of Defence.</p> \\n<p>When I saw the strain that the NHS was under, I felt it was my professional and moral obligation to offer my services. You would think that this would be fairly easy. The General Medical Council has been contacting doctors who have given up their registration in the past three years and they are being granted temporary registration if they wish to volunteer. But there is nothing on the GMC website directing registered doctors on how to volunteer.</p> \\n<p>The British Medical Association, the trade union representing doctors, has been of no help either. When I asked about this subject I was sent a couple of links to generic career advice and advertised jobs pages.</p> \\n<p>Other routes – eg Google searches, posting on LinkedIn and even some direct approaches to hospitals – have all been equally fruitless. I must say that I am at a total loss as to how I go about volunteering to work in the NHS in this time of crisis.

When “clap for carers” began, I was very moved, and of course there is something beautiful about the collective outpouring of gratitude. But the neglect and underfunding of the NHS have been screamingly obvious in every period in which the Conservatives have been in office. The drive to privatise is in the Tory DNA. Sure, they are talking the talk now – how could they not? – and doing the right thing vis-a-vis the NHS, but this is only temporary.</p> \\n<p>So is it wrong to hope that the clapping and saucepan-banging might also be seen as a movement that declares: “We love our NHS. We hate what the Tories, in their ideological savagery, have done to it”? To borrow from a recent demo placard: how can we symbolically and practically “rage, rage against the lying of the right”?<br><strong>Peter Kaan</strong><br><em>Exeter, Devon</em></p> \\n<p>• Unlike John Crace (<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/apr/08/rishi-sunak-ditches-the-staight-talk-for-lessons-from-the-old-school\" title=\"\">Rishi Sunak ditches the straight-talk for lessons from the old school</a>, 8 April), I found Rishi Sunak’s “most terrifying utterance” his throwaway reference to his giveaway billions “having to be paid for”.

How many low-paid workers in essential services, currently being eulogised by ministers for saving the nation, will end up footing the bill?

       "   'body': '<p>Towards the end of his landmark work <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2007/dec/08/society1\" title=\"\">A Secular Age</a>, the philosopher Charles Taylor wrote that, while churches in the west have emptied at an accelerating rate in the 21st century, most of us still seemed to value their presence in our cities, towns and villages. Traditional places of worship are still cherished, Prof Taylor suggested, because they act “partly as a holder of ancestral memory, partly as a resource against some future need (eg a rite of passage, especially a funeral); or as a source of comfort and orientation in the face of some collective disaster”.</p> <p>That the coronavirus pandemic counts as a “collective disaster” is beyond dispute. But, at least in a physical sense, our churches, mosques and synagogues have found themselves <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/17/church-of-england-suspends-services-coronavirus\" title=\"\">unable to provide a space of refuge</a>. As with almost all other forms of human bonding, faith has been driven into the cybersphere by the need to socially distance. With the pews empty, this will be an Easter weekend like no other, both for regular churchgoers and for those who, in uniquely challenging times, might have been tempted to pay a visit.</p> <p>The timing of the lockdown has been cruel for the three main Abrahamic religions. Easter is preceded by the Jewish Passover and followed by Ramadan. Collective commemoration, reflection and celebration lie at the very core of these great religious festivals. But for Jews this week, the traditional gathering of extended families for the Seder meal (marking the ancient Hebrews’ liberation from slavery in Egypt) could only take place via Zoom and Skype. As <a href=\"https://forward.com/opinion/441753/the-coronavirus-is-transforming-judaism/\" title=\"\">one American rabbi</a> drily observed: “Judaism is (temporarily) not in the synagogue. Judaism is now in the cloud – which, let the record note, is a biblical euphemism for God.”</p> <p>The rites of passage to which Prof Taylor referred have been diminished to the point of being unrecognisable, stripped of the joys and consolations that come from communal witness. Guest lists for church weddings and baptisms have been torn up. Funerals have become heartbreakingly lonely affairs, with mourners limited, at best, to immediate family members. The ritual washing of the body before Islamic and Jewish burials has been jeopardised and complicated by fear of infection and limited access to personal protective equipment.</p> <p>As churches celebrate the Paschal mysteries behind closed doors, there has been <a href=\"https://www.spectator.co.uk/article/will-coronavirus-cause-a-religious-resurgence-or-its-ruination\" title=\"\">some concern</a> that, in countries such as Britain, coronavirus might finish off the job that decades of western secularisation began. Religious observance is a habit as well as an affirmation of faith; habits, once interrupted, are sometimes hard to resume. Given the work done by people of faith in helping the homeless, running food banks and channeling vital aid overseas, it is to be hoped that such fears are groundless.</p> <p>There is already evidence to suggest that they are. A study has <a href=\"https://www.thetablet.co.uk/news/12707/surge-in-online-google-searches-for-prayer-\" title=\"\">found that</a> as the pandemic spread last month, Google searches for the word “prayer” boomed across 75 countries, dwarfing anything previously seen in data going back to 2004. In Britain, online streaming of services from churches has generated virtual congregations <a href=\"https://www.thetablet.co.uk/news/12717/hundreds-of-thousands-of-catholics-attend-live-stream-mass\" title=\"\">far bigger</a> than the numbers of those previously attending in person. A similar pattern is being observed in Jewish synagogues. Isolation seems to be breeding the opposite of spiritual apathy.</p> <p>Britain’s churches, mosques and synagogues must continue to play their part in helping the country through this ordeal, as they will do this weekend. The idea of sacrifice lies at the heart of the Christian meaning of Easter. On a gloriously sunny bank holiday weekend, staying at home will be a necessary sacrifice for all of us to make. There will be more to come.</p>',\n",

       "   'body': '<p>The volume of food that would otherwise be wasted and is received every week by the UK’s largest food redistribution charity has more than doubled since the coronavirus lockdown.</p> <p>In a better-than-average “good week” FareShare would typically be given 350 tonnes of food via its 24 regional distribution centres, but this has soared to 711 tonnes a week after the government <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/20/london-pubs-cinemas-and-gyms-may-close-in-covid-19-clampdown\">ordered the closure</a> of millions of hospitality businesses around the country, it has revealed.</p> <p>The organisation takes good quality surplus food from across the industry – direct from suppliers as well as from supermarkets – and redistributes it to almost 11,000 frontline charities and community groups. This typically provides 1m meals a week to vulnerable and needy people, along with essentials for regional food banks run by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2019/nov/13/more-people-than-ever-turning-to-food-banks-charity-says\">the Trussell Trust</a> and smaller local projects.</p> <p>Its chief executive, Lindsay Boswell, said the organisation had “ripped up” its business model in order to adjust to the unprecedented disruption to the food and drink supply chain triggered by the outbreak of the coronavirus.</p> <p>“It’s been real plate-spinning,” said Boswell. “In the early phase we suffered from a complete collapse in food donations as shoppers rushed out to panic buy and demand soared. That was very worrying. Then the government’s decision to close food service companies opened the floodgates.</p> <p>“With diminishing numbers of volunteers due to self-isolation we had to channel all our resources into making sure it was collected on time and not wasted.” Without physical distancing restrictions the organisation would probably be tripling its flow of food, he estimates. There has also been a switch in focus from providing food for meals to assembling food parcels.</p> <p>Boswell says virtually all donations have been gratefully received although there had been some “well-motivated offers, including a pantechnicon full of iceberg lettuces” which could not be used due to a massive amount of existing salad crop. Even before the outbreak of the coronavirus, demand for surplus food had soared against a background of growing dependence on <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/food-banks\">food banks</a> and rising <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/homelessness\">homelessness </a>in the UK.</p> <p>But wholesalers have been struggling to deal with tens of thousands of tonnes of fruit and vegetables, fresh meat and dairy products no longer required by restaurants, hotels and schools.</p> <p>As much as £20m of food with a shelf life of less than three months was at one stage lying in warehouses, according to the Federation of Wholesale Distributors, after the government <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/20/london-pubs-cinemas-and-gyms-may-close-in-covid-19-clampdown\">ordered the closure</a> of millions of hospitality businesses around the country.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Callout callout-coronavirus\">  <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div data-callout-tagname=&quot;callout-coronavirus&quot;&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Callout&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;callout-coronavirus&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>Boswell added: “An estimated 35% of the calories we consume are outside the home. So if you think of all those meals, whether school lunches or going out to restaurants in the evening – that’s a lot of food that now has nowhere to go.”</p> <p>In London FareShare has partnered with the capital’s two other major food redistribution charities – City Harvest and the Felix Project – to provide a more targeted emergency response service for Londoners during the coronavirus crisis. The three organisations have formed the London Food Alliance, with each taking the lead in a designated borough to help distribute food to people in local communities.</p> <p>It is now boosting its 1,500-strong army of volunteers, helped by a new partnership with the British Red Cross, and in a single week it received more volunteer applications than for the whole of last year. “We regard many new volunteers as the fifth cavalry – we may not need you now but we will,” said Boswell. A call for experienced forklift operators led to 24 qualified people responding within just two hours.</p> <p>As well as routinely supplying surplus food, FareShare’s major supermarket partners are also providing “top up” food as well as funding to help with logistics. This week the Co-op convenience store chain scrapped its £2.5m Easter advertising campaign and will instead use the airtime to encourage viewers to donate to FareShare.</p>',\n",

       "   'body': '<p>Tommy Chong has got the munchies. It’s early afternoon in locked-down LA, and last night he was on the pot cookies. “My wife, Shelby, just made a whole batch of them – oatmeal and maple syrup.” He stops to correct himself. “I put the pot in there, and of course I put too much in. Last night it got me almost comatose. Shelby got kinda mad at me. You know like when a kid gets so stoned all you do is sit there and grin.” Chong is 82 next month.</p> <p>He sounds about four decades younger – his voice is deep, sexy, pulsing with life. Chong is one half of the most famous <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2014/dec/25/back-with-a-bong-why-we-need-stoner-movies-more-than-ever\">stoner comic partnership in history, Cheech and Chong</a>. In the 1970s, they not only sold out their live shows, they topped the album charts and had huge box-office hits with movies such as Up in Smoke and Cheech and Chong’s Next Movie. The double-act were as radical as they were bonkers. And while the films were ostensibly about two aspiring rock stars in search of the next spliff, they introduced audiences to a downtown, multiracial Los Angeles rarely seen in movies.</p> <p>Their characters, Pedro de Pacas (Richard “Cheech” Marin ) and Anthony “Man” Stoner (Chong), were hopeless wasters, but heroically so. In their frequent spats with the police, they invariably won – even if they didn’t have a clue how or indeed even notice that they had.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"46fee27a6c2b501f9f4a0e5bf4a78dfcbbf543c5\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/46fee27a6c2b501f9f4a0e5bf4a78dfcbbf543c5/0_0_3600_2457/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Tommy Chong, left, and Cheech Marin in Cheech and Chong in Concert, 1973.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"683\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Feel the vibe ...

After they split up he enjoyed success as a solo comic and businessman (though that ended up in a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2003/sep/20/film.usa\">jail sentence</a>). Before Cheech and Chong, he was a guitarist with Bobby Taylor and the Vancouvers, co-writing their hit single <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WsFuZ4Lap4Q\">Does Your Mama Know About Me</a> – a gorgeous song about a mixed-race relationship. Although they only had the one hit, the band were influential – something Chong is again quick to point out. A young Jimi Hendrix played with them, and they were partly responsible for the Jackson Five (who opened for them in 1968) signing to Motown. Or rather Chong was.</p> <p>“I was the lawyer who signed the contract for them,” he says. Hold on, I say, you’re not a lawyer. Chong laughs. “Well, I was the whitest guy they knew. I looked like a Jewish guy, a lawyer. So literally Bobby Taylor took the contract and gave it to me and said what d’you think?” Chong gave it the OK and the rest is history.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"48b7aec2e1f97ba99e4ce675ea58a2a2090d570d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/48b7aec2e1f97ba99e4ce675ea58a2a2090d570d/0_0_3504_2123/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Roll up, roll up ...

Chong and Marin in the 1978 comedy Up in Smoke.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Allstar/Paramount</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Chong segues from one celebrity anecdote to another, all of them connected by one degree of separation – himself. And now we have landed at British royalty. “I played <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WsFuZ4Lap4Q\">Does Your Mama Know</a> for Prince Harry. We were in the Spencers’ house. We went there for a wedding two years ago.” Did he get high with Harry? “He was busy with the wedding,” Chong says, discreetly. “He took a liking to Shelby because she had read all about him and knew his life story.”</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--inline\"> <blockquote> <p>England is probably the most racist country in the world with its royalty and its caste system</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>He may have a lot of time for Harry and Meghan, but not for the royal family as a whole. “England itself is probably the most racist country in the world with its royalty and its caste system.” Chong does not like to hold back. “You still have the system that colonised the world. Meghan wasn’t white enough. She would never be white enough. I can see why they left. Megan could never be accepted into the royal family. She knew that and the whole family did. The whole English system is set up that way.”</p> <p>From the royals he turns to Donald Trump. He doesn’t know Trump personally, but he says he remembers coming across his type as a young man in British Columbia. “I knew people like Trump all my life in Canada – we called them gangsters. And they hung around the Stock Exchange in Vancouver. That’s where his grandpa made all his money. Running whores, and gambling joints and bootlegging.”</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"8ef6988271b6f9bc48bf0362fd729e7ffa36c68b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8ef6988271b6f9bc48bf0362fd729e7ffa36c68b/0_0_3182_2400/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Bobby Taylor and The Vancouvers ...clockwise from top, Bobby Taylor, Wes Henderson and Tommy Chong in about 1968.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"754\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Bobby Taylor and The Vancouvers ...clockwise from top, Bobby Taylor, Wes Henderson and Tommy Chong in about 1968.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Michael Ochs Archives/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Chong is convinced that once he leaves office, Trump will face criminal charges. “He is a Russian asset. History will show that. He’s been colluding with Russia from the get-go – the Mueller report even said it. The only reason they couldn’t do anything is because he’s the president, and the minute Trump’s not president they’re gonna put his ass in jail.”</p> <p>It’s a big claim. Do you really think Trump will end up jailed? “Yes. If Harvey Weinstein and Bill Cosby are an example, yes, I think he will. So he’s going to go. He’s insulted too many people.” When you go after judges, he says, it comes back to bite you in the ass.</p> <p>One of the things he finds most offensive about Trump is his attitude to people of colour. “Just because you were born with money don’t make you any better than anybody else on the planet, but he’s still sticking to that thing that because he’s white and privileged he somehow is better than other people.”</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--inline\"> <blockquote> <p>I knew people like Trump all my life in Canada –\\xa0we called them gangsters</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Race, and racism, has been at the heart of Chong’s life and his humour. He grew up in Calgary, a conservative Canadian city, the son of a Chinese father and a Canadian mother with Celtic roots. He still sounds shocked by the attitudes he experienced there as a child. “You know, they would sell brazil nuts in the grocery store and they’d call them nigger toes. And they had little <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/wordofmouth/2010/may/25/consider-liquorice\">black liquorice beans</a> called nigger babies. ‘Can I have five cents worth of nigger babies?’ Again he laughs – this time appalled. “That’s where I grew up.”<br><br>As a young boy he remembers his whole class apart from him being invited to a birthday party. “I just looked out of the window of the second storey and could see my friends gathering around the fire. I was uninvited ’cos the girl’s father was worried she might end up with a coloured guy or Chinese guy.”</p> <p>By then, he was already used to being isolated. When he was a baby, his mother contracted TB and he developed pleurisy. “My first memories are hospital and my mom was quarantined in a sanitarium. I never saw her for the first three or four years of my life. So I feel I’ve been through this pandemic before with my mother.”</p> <p>How is he coping? He says he is missing his five children and the grandchildren. “It affects everybody’s life. We can’t do our family reunions. It’s lonely. Even though you’ve got your kids a phone call away, you still want to hold them and hug them and be part of their life.” But, he stresses, he’s lucky – he’s got Shelby’s company, her gourmet cooking and the pot cookies.<br><br>It was in the late 60s that he teamed up with Richard Marin, a Mexican-American whose nickname was Cheech. They played music and did comedy sketches in a Vancouver strip club. The funny stuff soon took over, and the strip club became a comedy club.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"df09c878567d4aac311df06c4640a275404cac55\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/df09c878567d4aac311df06c4640a275404cac55/711_304_4993_2995/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Marin and Chong pose, in 2018, to commemorate the 40th anniversary of Up in Smoke.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Marin and Chong pose, in 2018, to commemorate the 40th anniversary of Up in Smoke.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Ron Eshel/Invision/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Cheech and Chong prided themselves on taking things to extremes – spliffs the size of tubas (famously smoking labarador poo in their first film, Up in Smoke), idiocy off the IQ ratings and staggeringly incorrect sexual politics (in Cheech and Chong’s Next Movie, Cheech only desists from having sex with a woman who seems to have died on him because she wakes up).</p> <p>He says his favourite Cheech and Chong sketch is Hey, Margaret – about a husband describing a porn film to his wife. First, an elderly woman has sex with the pizza delivery man, then she has sex with a dog, and the husband reports it all back to Margaret with relish. Finally, she has sex with a “god-damned coloured guy” and the husband turns away sickened. It was bad-taste comedy with bigotry as the butt of the joke.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7GwxVGUJRzE\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/7GwxVGUJRzE?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>Why does he think they were so popular? Simple, he says. “We communicated with people. They would get high to come and see us and then we’d act crazy and make them laugh.”</p> <p>Could they really be such dedicated stoners and still be so prolific, or was it an act? Chong sounds slightly offended by the question. “Oh no, for the most part we were always high. We always smoked a little before we went out there. That was part of the job.”</p> <p>Drugs, he says, were essential to the creative process. “It was my job as a writer and performer to deliver the goods. So if that meant being stoned, I gladly did it. I found that the more stoned I was, the more crazy the movie was, and the more successful we were.” What was his drug of choice when writing? Oh, he says, there were a few. “A little bit of cocaine and the acid and then the weed.”</p> <p>Cheech and Chong appeared to be having the time of their lives. But by the mid-80s they had fallen out. “We had some pretty heated arguments. Cheech would go on vacation and I’d be left alone to write the movies. Then he’d come back and I’d direct them, and he got tired of it. He was thinking I got too much credit.” Did he have a point? “ Well, I maintain that if he’d listened to me it would have been better all the way around.”</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--inline\"> <blockquote> <p>The only way people listen to you is if you’re the director. If you’re not the director, people don’t give a shit what you’ve got to say</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>In his memoir, Marin called Chong “the world’s humblest megalomaniac”. Talking to Chong today, I get a sense of what he means. Alongside the hippy-dippy mellowness, there is a man who clearly likes doing things his way. “The only way people listen to you is if you’re the director. If you’re not the director, people don’t give a shit what you’ve got to say.” So it was a power struggle between him and Marin? “Well, yeah, for sure. Because what Cheech wanted was the part where you got the power.”</p> <p>Chong calls Marin a genius – not just for his comedic skills, but for his photographic memory and the sharpness of his brain. As for himself, he says his great gift has always been for teaming up with the right person – whether it be Marin or Shelby, his second wife, to whom he has been married for 45 years.</p> <p>At times, he sounds calculated when he talks about what Marin brought to the table. “We clicked from the off. And I soon realised I’ve got a goldmine with this guy because LA is made up mostly of Mexicans. So I realised, oh man, we can own this place with comedy. And we do. I mean our comedy’s lasted longer than anything.”</p> <p>In the end, he says, it was money that did for them. “I always say we broke up ’cos we got rich. My joke is you can’t make a rich Mexican do shit! Hehehe! That still makes me laugh.” Did wealth change them? “Yea. You make the wrong decision. You’d rather do your summer house than go on the road again.” Chong says if you’re in the entertainment business and you’re not 100% dedicated to entertaining, you might as well give up. And they did.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"b6c90bbf10dd9839c67e6d30b096be0053177bfc\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b6c90bbf10dd9839c67e6d30b096be0053177bfc/0_0_3000_1646/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Tommy and Shelby Chong and Cheech Marin perform at the Cheech &amp; Chong show in New Jersey in 2018.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"549\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Tommy and Shelby Chong and Cheech Marin perform at the Cheech &amp; Chong show in New Jersey in 2018.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Bobby Bank/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>After the split, Chong developed his solo standup. But he hated being away from Shelby. “I couldn’t leave my wife at home. She’s too beautiful to leave alone.” (He tells me three times how beautiful she is and how much he loves her.) So Shelby learned how to do standup and went on the road with him. Occasionally, in his live act he would phone Cheech, but Cheech refused to play along. “He wouldn’t be funny, so I quit phoning him.” And they fell out some more.</p> <p>In 2003, at the age of 65, Chong was jailed for nine months for selling glass pipes on the internet that could be used for smoking cannabis (though they were produced as collectible works of art): each bong had his name and a picture of his face on it. It was a family business, and Chong agreed to plead guilty in exchange for the non-prosecution of Shelby and his son Paris.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"c777c301989bd86d39ebffbfbd590194bc8c9c37\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c777c301989bd86d39ebffbfbd590194bc8c9c37/0_0_2000_1230/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Chong leaves the federal court in Pittsburgh in 2003 after pleading guilty to conspiring to sell drug paraphernalia.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"615\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Chong leaves the federal court in Pittsburgh in 2003 after pleading guilty to conspiring to sell drug paraphernalia.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Keith Srakocic/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>He says jail changed him, physically and spiritually. He spent his time <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/shortcuts/2015/feb/16/mark-rylance-used-i-ching-for-career-can-it-help-chose-my-lunch\">reading the I Ching</a> and became more at peace with himself. His hair and beard turned white, and he emerged from incarceration looking rather professorial. Since then he has seen off two cancers, and returned to the road.</p> <p>Despite the rise of rightwing populists, impending environmental catastrophe and the Covid-19 pandemic, he says life has never been better.“I see today as the best time to be alive because we weren’t content with what we had. We were always looking for that better club, the better audience to play in front of.”</p> <p>In his 80s, he has never been more occupied – gigging with Shelby, launching his own brand of marijuana (<a href=\"https://tommychong.com/\">Chong’s Choice</a>) in 2016 when the drug was legalised for recreational use in California, and spending time with his kids. He even made up with Cheech, thanks to Paris. A decade ago his son found an email from Marin on Chong’s computer asking if he wanted to try to put aside differences – Paris didn’t bother to tell his dad, wrote yes and hit reply.</p> <p>Since then Cheech and Chong have been gigging again, with Shelby as their opening act. On the day we speak, he is supposed to be promoting a Cheech and Chong video game, but he is too excited about new opportunities to mention it. Doe he think the duo might make another film? Silence. But I can sense his boyish excitement at the other end of the line. “Well I can’t really tell you that now,” he says coyly. So there might be one? “I’ve got to wait till it’s a reality as opposed to telling you dreams. I’ll turn it into a reality and then I’ll tell you.”</p> <p>And with that he’s off to satisfy those munchies and realise his dreams.</p> <p>• <a href=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.LDRLY.cheechandchong&amp;fbclid=IwAR2xj-ydYBefXm3qRn6tpBvJ0JYhS2qnk4lZ8I0GbJXiTdjvngUo8NVkAA8\">The Cheech &amp; Chong Bud Farm video game</a> is <a href=\"https://apps.apple.com/us/app/cheech-and-chong-bud-farm/id1498492128?fbclid=IwAR3fwQskLbdqsiRSmoMLw40rlhyXd0zv5Fb4lAAEddpoFq6Aj-Z36pH93F4\">available for download on 20 April</a></p>',\n",

The anecdotes flow freely as Braff describes the moment they became JD and Turk and their bromance began immediately. “Every time I was playing the wide-eyed guy walking around, I was just being me because I couldn’t believe it was happening,” says Braff. They mirror their characters a lot as they talk about their hatred of the show’s credits, X-ray blunders and more. <em>Hannah Verdier</em></p> <p><strong><a href=\"https://podcasts.apple.com/tr/podcast/unlocking-us-with-bren%C3%A9-brown/id1494350511\">Unlocking Us</a> </strong><br>Oprah-endorsed self-help queen, academic and bestselling author Brené Brown hosts this podcast, essentially an anxiety-quelling Ted talk in audio form. If that sounds worthy, perhaps it’s exactly the boost we need right now; not least in the first episode, where Brown throws out a Mandela quote and implores us to temper our expectations with new experiences (or FFTs, “effing first times”), especially in the current pandemic (“I’m a grown-ass person, but I don’t know what the hell I’m doing … ”). <em>Hannah J Davies</em></p> <h2>Producer pick: <a href=\"https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/heres-the-deal/id1505238447\">Here’s the Deal</a></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"29a13c59b8ffd14a4bd57fdcfd8e3af7380e9ffd\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/29a13c59b8ffd14a4bd57fdcfd8e3af7380e9ffd/0_400_6000_3600/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Talking politics ...

In a week that saw Biden’s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/apr/08/bernie-sanders-ends-2020-presidential-race\">only rival for the democratic nominee suspend his campaign</a>, he sat down (virtually of course) with the Michigan Governor <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/aug/02/michigan-governor-race-progressive-candidates\">Gretchen Whitmer</a>. She is the reason to listen to this week’s episode. Whitmer has simultaneously garnered admiration from the more powerful Democrat players, and drawn ire from a certain Republican in the White House for how she’s dealing with Covid-19 in her state.</p> <p>She talks about having to work, and enjoy working, with Republicans across the aisle to build a consensus – breath of fresh air for anyone who, like me, who feels bipartisanship has been all but lost in the US. There’s a small monologue by Biden in the middle about how great Americans have been through the coronavirus crisis, but you can skip that and come back in for the listener’s questions at the end.</p> <p>Unfortunately for Joe, I don’t think he’s found his calling in podcasting. But it will certainly be interesting to see who else appears on the show in the run up to the November election.</p> <h2>Talking points</h2> <ul> <li><p>This week, the Guardian fashion desk compiled a list of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2020/apr/06/club-tropicana-vanity-fair-and-hollywood-makeovers-the-best-podcasts-for-fashion-fans\">best audio shows for style fans</a>, from feminist art with Dior to a huge range of sustainable initiatives in Wardrobe Crisis.</p></li> <li><p>Why not try: <a href=\"https://open.spotify.com/show/39uNfujSpWRmUYFpw9zkSw?si=3KL6Y0Q_RJWhCIkH9C_q2w\">Gurls Talk with Adwoa Aboah</a> | <a href=\"https://www.latimes.com/coronaviruspodcast\">Coronavirus in California</a> | <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p0874xc6/episodes/downloads\">This Game Changed My Life</a></p></li> </ul>',\n",

I remember playing with Agassi after Andre had 18 months out, for very different reasons, but he came back fresh and invigorated to play. He kept going until he was 36.</p> <p>“In those days that was old for a top tennis player. I stopped when I was 33 and that was pretty old at the time. But with training techniques and injury prevention, players are certainly playing longer. So you would like to think that if Andy’s body permits and he still has the motivation that I think he does there can still definitely be a few Wimbledons left in him yet.”</p> <p>Henman said he had spoken to Roger Federer, who had planned to make his comeback at Wimbledon after knee surgery, and reckoned the eight-times champion, at 38, would be similarly frustrated, with dwindling opportunities left to add to his 20 majors. “Someone like Federer, coming to the end of his career, is devastated but understands the decision. It will affect a lot of people in a lot of different ways.”</p> <p>Henman is particularly concerned the disruption will hit low-ranked players hardest. “Further down the pecking order this will have huge implications where people are not going to have an income.”</p> <p>He also added his voice to those of the outgoing All England Club chief executive, Richard Lewis, and the relatively new ATP chairman, Andrea Gaudenzi, who fear there is a possibility the 2020 calendar may be wiped out entirely. “You have got to be positive and optimistic that [the US Open in August] can be played but, if it weren’t, I don’t think anyone would be greatly surprised,” Henman said.</p> <p>The game’s next big event may be the second ATP Cup, where Henman made a confident debut as the Great Britain coach at the start of the year, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/jan/09/australia-edge-great-britain-in-atp-cup-quarter-final-thriller\" title=\"\">leading them to the quarter-finals</a>. “If I were asked to do it again, schedule permitting, I would definitely do it because it was a lot of fun,” he said.</p> <p>“If you had said a month ago the next event was going to be the ATP Cup in Australia in January, I think people would have looked at you a bit strangely.

Two weeks ago she got a call saying the interview was cancelled. “I feel so sad and frustrated. I’d been nervous about leaving uni and getting an interview was really exciting,” she says.</p> <p>Many are in similar positions. Alice Cole (not her real name) is in her final year at the University of Brighton and wanted to go into the NGO sector as a researcher. She was feeling confident about her prospects after graduation and there were jobs available, but the outlook has changed rapidly. “Because of coronavirus, funding for NGOs is getting smaller and there are fewer jobs at entry-level positions,” she says. “It won’t be possible anymore.”</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2020/apr/06/students-tell-of-a-future-snatched-away-covid-19\">\\'A weird time\\': students tell of a future snatched away</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Students are starting to realise they will be graduating into a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/08/coronavirus-putting-world-on-track-for-new-great-depression-says-who\">global recession</a>. According to the Institute of Student Employers (ISE), many firms have scaled down their recruitment of entry-level staff and more than a quarter of businesses are reducing the number of graduates they hire this year.</p> <p>While some firms are moving assessments and interviews online, the majority have cancelled them. “Thousands of young people are supposed to be entering the labour market from July and they could be left without work and nothing to do while coronavirus is sorted out,” says Stephen Isherwood, chief executive of the ISE. “We need to make sure that a whole generation isn’t lost.”</p> <p>One graduate recruiter says they have already retracted offers. “Firms are being realistic and most are putting recruitment on hold. No one wants to offer an opportunity which might not be there in three months’ time.”</p> <p>Routes into graduate jobs have also been affected. Short-term work such as internships and placements will be reduced by almost a third, say the ISE, and 68% of firms have cancelled work experience and taster opportunities. As a result, <a href=\"https://trendence.co.uk/downloads/coronavirus-pandemic-gen-z-study\">almost 40% of students</a> are now worried they won’t be able to get a job at all.</p> <p>James Turner, CEO of the Sutton Trust, says although we don’t know the full extent of the virus on the graduate job market yet, shrinking opportunities tend to be bad for social mobility, with students unable to access internships and other work experience placements. He says: “Internships are increasingly necessary for many graduate jobs, and there is a risk that young people with professional connections may be able to find work experience while other, openly-advertised, opportunities cease to exist.”</p> <p>Nick Hillman, director of the Higher Education Policy Institute, says although most companies will feel the impact, there will be some big winners and some losers depending on the sector. “Even in this crisis, some employers are booming. Technology companies, the food sector and logistics firms are busier than ever,” he says. “You might not end up with the job you hoped for but you can get a job.”</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/law/2020/apr/03/how-will-law-exams-be-affected-by-coronavirus\">How will law exams be affected by coronavirus?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Students can also rely on their university careers’ services, and Kim Connor Streich, marketing director of the Debut Careers app, thinks it is vital that applicants practice video interviews and presenting on camera.</p> <p>Others, however, think we will see more students deciding to take master’s degrees or further courses of study. In other times of recession, staying on at university has been a good alternative to struggling to get a job, with the hope that individuals will emerge not only with improved skills but into a recovering jobs market. Cole thinks this is her only option. “I live in a rural area of Wales so there are very few job opportunities around here. I’m currently looking into doing a master’s,” she says. “The easiest thing to do right now is to delay entering the job market by a year so things have a chance to get back to normal.”</p> <p>James Catchpole, director of the legal practice course at the City Law School, thinks the end result may be a more highly skilled workforce. “We need to make sure we prepare them even better than we have done and turn them into even better candidates,” he says.</p> <p>Hillman agrees. “You can get government-backed loans for postgraduate study, and unis will be falling over themselves to recruit home students as international numbers will be down significantly.”</p>',\n",

       "   'body': '<h2><strong>Monday</strong></h2> <p>In the early days of the coronavirus pandemic, each NHS trust would send out individual emails of the number of people who had died. Now the daily totals are approaching the 1,000 mark, we are down to one global email per day. It feels as if so many people are losing their individual identity and just becoming a statistic. So to redress the balance a little, I would like to tell you about Pete, who died of Covid-19 last weekend, the first person I have known to have died of the disease. Just so that he and thousands of others like him don’t get forgotten.</p> <p>Pete wasn’t a close friend: more of a friend of a friend and someone my wife would join on long weekend walks. But he was a lovely man. He was at Exeter University several years before me – he took his studies so seriously, it took him four years to complete a three-year degree – but photos from that time show him as a dead ringer for Steely Dan’s Jeff “Skunk” Baxter. He was also known for driving his motorbike far too fast and for crashing cars. On leaving Exeter, he went on to establish his own communications business in Brighton and was heavily involved in several charities working in India and Africa. He is survived by his wife, Heidi, and his two children. My heart goes out to them. It’s still not clear what the rules are for funerals in the time of the coronavirus but it will undoubtedly be a scaled back affair. Sometime, when this horror is all over, we will have a party to remember him properly. And for all the many others whose deaths were merely reported as a grim number at the daily Downing Street press conference.</p> <h2><strong>Tuesday</strong></h2> <p>I found myself totally unsettled by the news that Boris Johnson had been moved to the intensive care unit at St Thomas’ hospital. So much so, that I had to switch off Twitter and stop watching the news: even though it is literally my job to watch the news. Part of the shock was that less than three hours earlier, Dominic Raab had insisted at the Downing Street press conference that Boris had only gone to hospital <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/apr/05/boris-johnson-admitted-to-hospital-with-coronavirus\">as a precaution</a> and was basically still in charge of the country. So the only possible conclusion was that Raab had lied about the gravity of Boris’s condition or that, even as de facto deputy prime minister, he had not been kept in the loop. Neither of which inspired much confidence in the government. If we couldn’t trust the government to tell the truth about something so critical as the prime minister’s health, why should we trust it to tell the truth about anything else? The No 10 communications team really needs to start upping its game: we’re long past the point where serious news can be withheld for a few hours. But mostly my shock at the deterioration of Boris’s condition was on a more existential level. You can dislike his politics and think little of of his suitability as prime minister, but he is still the country’s leader. At a very basic, psychoanalytical level Boris is the country’s daddy. And no one ever wants to lose their dad, no matter how crap a dad he has been. We want our parents to be strong. Invincible, even. The last thing we want is proof that the coronavirus really is totally indiscriminate.</p> <h2>Wednesday</h2> <p>Finding ways of filling up the days – other than with work – is proving to be more and more of a challenge. I have had two more goes at Hilary Mantel’s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2020/mar/01/the-mirror-and-the-light-hilary-mantel-review-thomas-cromwell\">The Mirror and the Light</a> but still haven’t got the concentration to get past the first four pages. That makes it six attempts at the book so far, but it’s testament to the power of the writing that I have been gripped on each occasion. By this time next week, I am determined to make it to at least page six. My wife is rather more inventive than me and had found on Twitter the #GettyMuseumChallenge, which encouraged everyone to recreate works of art using objects they had lying around the house. After a great deal of passive resistance from me – “Why on earth would I want to do that?” – Jill persuaded me to join her as Piero della Francesca’s Duke and Duchess of Urbino.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"c57c461dcc0875e37df49931242a491d9ef76b48\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c57c461dcc0875e37df49931242a491d9ef76b48/0_693_5200_3120/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Portraits of Duke and Duchess of Urbino, by Piero della Francesca, circa 1475, in the Uffizi Gallery, Florence.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Portraits of Duke and Duchess of Urbino, by Piero della Francesca, circa 1475, in the Uffizi Gallery, Florence.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Peter Barritt/Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Her costume was constructed using some lace bought from a French market some years ago, along with a pair of headphones covered with tin foil and a paper flower. Mine was made from some red felt, left over from making one of the children’s Christmas stockings, rounded off with a heavy Le Creuset saucepan for the head gear. It certainly had the necessary gravitas. Once the pictures were taken against the kitchen wall, our son Photoshopped them into the appropriate frame and we posted the diptych on Twitter and got a wonderful response from many people. Apart from the bloke who suggested I should have gone the whole hog and broken my nose like the original duke. Now our fame is to be extended further. Yesterday I got an email from a producer working on a TV film Grayson Perry is making about creativity in lockdown, requesting permission to use our photo. A Bafta surely must be in the offing.</p> <h2>Thursday</h2> <p>I have spent most of the football season wishing Spurs could play rather more like Liverpool and less like a bunch of bored, non-league players. And much to my surprise, I have found that I have missed the final two months of the season far less than I expected. It turns out that there are limits to my masochism and were the Premier League to announce that the final placings for this year’s season were as of the beginning of March, I’d be quite happy. If we can’t make the Champions League we can at least avoid the Europa League. Best of all, though, would be for the entire season to be considered null and void so that Spurs would automatically qualify for the Champions league on last season’s performances. </p> <p>But now I find myself not just wishing Spurs would play like Liverpool but behave like them too. Earlier this week, Liverpool announced it had made an error in laying off and furloughing many of its non-playing staff and were going to retain them all. Just a week after announcing profits in excess of £70m, the Tottenham board – despite much pressure from the supporters’ trust and other interested parties – came to an entirely different decision and is laying off and furloughing non-playing staff. At White Hart Lane, the directors seem to care more about the bottom line than basic human decency. To make things even worse, the club has broken physical-distancing guidelines by holding training sessions in the park. I’ve sometimes been ashamed of Spurs’ on-field performances; now I am ashamed of their off-field ones. It’s not too late to reverse the decision. The club may be surprised at just how many fans won’t forget or forgive if they don’t.</p> <h2><strong>Friday</strong></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"4774071928b826df4ec0dfda95606ed2e2f4ccd7\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4774071928b826df4ec0dfda95606ed2e2f4ccd7/0_70_3500_2101/1000.jpg\" alt=\"An image on a hoarding in London of the Queen broadcasting her message\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Queen: Next, they’ll be having me sing Vera Lynn</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Dominic Lipinski/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>There’s no getting away from it. As for many people, it’s been another tricky week on the mental health front. I miss my children more and more – I dare say I might be feeling differently about this if they were both still teenagers and going stir crazy indoors – and our frequent phone calls are bitter-sweet reminders of the distance between us. It’s the not knowing when I will next get to see them that hurts the most, and I am planning on observing government guidelines to the letter. But I did promise to try to include some good news each week, so here goes. </p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/apr/10/boris-johnson-father-stanley-tells-relief-pm-leaves-intensive-care\">Boris Johnson is out of intensive care</a>: I feel far more emotional about that than I expected. I’ve also spent the last three and a half weeks growing a beard, something I’ve never done in the past. So that’s a first. I’m not sure it’s a total success though and I doubt it will be staying much longer. My sisters have been polite about it but my friend Alex said I look like a serial rapist on death row. I’ve also now almost finished cataloguing my books, which has been mind-numbingly dull and unexpectedly time consuming as my spreadsheet skills are minimal. Next I plan to move on to cataloguing our ceramics. Soon I will be down to cataloguing the exact amount of dog and cat food we have left. But the undoubted highlight of the week has been the arrival of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/apr/08/wisden-2020-offers-plenty-scope-cricket-loving-self-isolators-ben-stokes\">this year’s Wisden Almanack</a>. I haven’t had time to more than dip in so far – Mark Lawson’s moving essay on how cricket helped his mental health was my first port of call – but the new Wisden is always a sure sign of the start of summer. Though what kind of summer it will be is still in the lap of the coronavirus. And who knows what next year’s Wisden will look like?</p> <p><strong>Digested week, digested:</strong> Same again.</p>',\n",

       "   'body': '<p>Labour must be a party of responsibility that backs frontline police officers and promises to keep the public safe from crime, the new shadow home secretary, Nick Thomas-Symonds, says.</p> \\n<p>In an interview with the Guardian, the Welsh MP, promoted to the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/apr/05/three-key-appointments-keir-starmer-fills-top-shadow-cabinet-roles\">shadow cabinet</a> in Keir Starmer’s comprehensive reshuffle last weekend, said crime was a “progressive issue”, and lavished praise on the police for enforcing the coronavirus lockdown.</p> \\n<p>“Labour have a message that we will keep you, your family and your community safe. That’s very much the approach that I come from,” he said.</p> \\n<p>“I grew up in the constituency I represent, in the eastern valley of the South Wales coalfields, in an era when jobs and opportunities were being taken away by the Thatcher government. And it really did strike me then, that crime was an issue that progressives had to be serious about.”</p> \\n<p>“Responsibility is the word that I would use,” he said. “Responsibility to others, to society: there is such a thing as society, there’s no doubt about that. Crimes have victims; they damage the fabric of that society. But there is a responsibility for government as well, and it’s the responsibility to keep people safe.”</p> \\n<p>He was at pains to praise the police officers given the task of enforcing the coronavirus lockdown, despite widely cited instances of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/mar/30/uk-police-guidelines-coronavirus-lockdown-enforcement-powers-following-criticism-lord-sumption\">over-zealousness</a>.</p> \\n<p>“I’ve obviously seen those various incidents that have happened. But I just think it’s unfair when I as a politician have handed over this enormous set of powers, to then start picking on particular officers and particular forces.</p> \\n<p>“What I’m trying to do is to recognise the difficult situation, and the latitude we do need to give to our officers,” he said. “By and large, I think the police are getting it right.”</p> \\n<p>With some of the best-known figures in Jeremy Corbyn’s shadow cabinet relegated to the backbenches, either voluntarily or at Starmer’s hand, Thomas-Symonds and his new shadow cabinet colleagues will be intently scrutinised for clues to Labour’s direction.</p> \\n<p>Like the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/apr/02/is-keir-starmer-failing-call-out-government-coronavirus\">party’s new leader</a>, he strikes a resolutely constructive tone regarding the government’s handling of the virus.</p> \\n<p>“In a public health emergency, a national crisis like this – it’s difficult to think of anything comparable since 1945, frankly – my view is that we have to support the government in the aim of minimising loss of life through the crisis. That’s absolutely in the national interest, and absolutely what we aim to do. But we have to balance it with scrutiny,” he said.</p> \\n<p>But Thomas-Symonds said he hoped the crucial frontline role played by NHS workers and others in the crisis, and the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/video/2020/apr/10/thousands-across-uk-applaud-nhs-workers-on-third-week-of-clapforcarers-video\">weekly nationwide round of applause</a>, would help to change attitudes to migration.</p> \\n<p>The government’s new points-based system, due to come into force next year, is expected to set a salary threshold of £25,600 – or more in some sectors – with the aim of halting low-skilled migration.</p> \\n<p>“One thing I really hope this crisis has taught the Conservatives, is that the value of what people do is not always reflected in the salary that they’re paid,” Thomas-Symonds said.</p> \\n<p>“We hear a lot of warm words about our police, the ambulance services, the fire services, our NHS workers, our care workers. But take nurses: when you look at the salary threshold that’s being proposed, nurses, especially when they’re starting off, are below it, and I think the government has to seriously look at how we value people in our society.”</p> \\n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"69935b48-c2b3-4b2c-8945-fa8b7bcba6a9\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \\n  <div>\\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/BS0PhRAx2W8?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\\n  </div>\\n </gu-atom> \\n</figure> \\n<p>He declined to be drawn on what migration system Labour would like to see, saying it would be “fairer”, and that developing it in detail would be an important focus for the party over the next two to three years.</p> \\n<p>“In terms of migration and broad principles, Labour’s an internationalist party. Labour will always believe in the right to live and to work in other countries. Of course we will; also in terms of fairness, and a recognition that the immigration system is about people. It’s not about numbers, it’s not about statistics, it’s about people,” he said, describing the Windrush scandal as a “shameful” episode.</p> \\n<p>While little known outside Westminster, the 39-year-old has written two biographies of Labour’s great figures – Aneurin Bevan and Clement Attlee – and practised as a barrister until becoming an MP in 2015.</p> \\n<p>Before training as a lawyer, he taught politics at Oxford University. “I’ve studied the history of the home secretaries, and my impression is that the really successful home secretaries are strategic,” he said. “They have a really strong sense of what their priorities are, and they give a very strong sense of direction, and when that disappears, I think that’s when you start to get into trouble.”</p> \\n<p>He is surprised his Tory opposite number, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/apr/08/priti-patel-accused-of-avoiding-mps-scrutiny-during-national-crisis\">Priti Patel</a>, has not played a more prominent role during the crisis. Major decisions are being overseen by a “quad” of senior ministers, chaired in the prime minister’s absence by the first secretary, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/apr/06/dominic-raab-set-to-lead-uk-through-covid-19-hurdles\">Dominic Raab</a>, and including the health secretary, Matt Hancock, the chancellor, Rishi Sunak, and the cabinet office minister, Michael Gove.</p> \\n<p>Asked about Patel’s absence from the inner circle, Thomas-Symonds says: “I do think the home secretary should be out on the media regularly, showing her support for our police officers. We want to say them very clearly as politicians, we back what you’re doing and we understand the difficulties.”</p> \\n<p><br></p>',\n",

       "   'body': '<p>Oscar-winning Spanish film director Pedro Almodóvar has written “a settling of scores” in a long diary entry written during the coronavirus lockdown, which accuses Madonna of treating him and actor Antonio Banderas as “simpletons”, and not asking permission to use footage of them in a documentary.</p> <p>In the post <a href=\"https://www.indiewire.com/2020/04/pedro-almodovar-quarantine-essay-madonna-1202223894/\">published in translation on IndieWire</a>, Almodóvar recalls first meeting Madonna on the set of the film Dick Tracy, and then later in Madrid during her 1990 Blond Ambition world tour. “Aside from myself, she was only interested in meeting one other guest, Antonio Banderas,” he said of the latter meeting, with Banderas having recently acted in Almodóvar’s film Tie Me Up! Tie Me Down!. “Hollywood (and Madonna) had fallen in love with him.”</p> <p>Madonna had the flamenco party Almodóvar had arranged for her filmed for the documentary Madonna: Truth or Dare (also known as In Bed With Madonna). “She didn’t ask for permission to use our images, and she even dubbed me, because my English mustn’t have been that good,” Almodóvar complains. “I don’t mind if this seems like a settling of scores – if it had been the other way round (me filming Madonna and her team and making a film with all that material which I would then premiere around the world), I would have taken such a hit in the form of a lawsuit; I’d still be recovering from it. Madonna treated us like simpletons and I had to say it one day.”</p> <p>He said Madonna decided on the seating plan and placed Banderas’s then-wife Ana Leza far away from him, with herself by his side. “Antonio’s harassment was one of the main storylines and she, obviously, edited in how she dispatched Ana Leza with only one sentence. At the end of the dinner, Ana dared to get close to our table and told the divine blonde sarcastically, ‘I see you like my husband, it doesn’t surprise me, all women like him, but I don’t mind because I am very modern.’ To which Madonna replied: ‘Get lost.’ All this may seem frivolous, and it is.”</p> <p>He also says Madonna also asked Banderas, who didn’t speak English then, a provocative question via Almodóvar. “Ask him, she told me again, if he likes women to hit him … Antonio made the same gesture, which meant neither/nor, but that he was at the service of ladies’ desires.”</p> <p>Madonna has not responded to his post. The Guardian has contacted her UK representatives for comment.</p>',\n",

If that is the case, England internationals could be unavailable for their clubs for weeks on end, given the 2020 Six Nations tournament also needs to be completed, raising questions over player welfare and player release. The scenario could mean England playing anywhere up to seven matches in October and November.</p> <p>Any proposal to restructure the season would have to be put to the Premiership via the Professional Game Board but a senior source said that in the autumn “there will be a massive compression of club and international fixtures and it’s not all going to fit”.</p> <p>World Rugby sees the international game as the priority because of the revenues it can drive, and is expected to confirm contingency plans for its summer tours this month as unions anticipate crippling losses. The RFU is forecasting losses of £50m in the next 18 months but can make around £10m per home match with Twickenham fixtures accounting for 85% of the union’s revenue.</p> <p>Sweeney told the BBC: “We might go [to Japan] in October.

An obvious one is: do you stage a Six Nations in the autumn but link it into the Six Nations the next year, and you have a home and away series?”</p> <p>The Japan tour was to be a developmental opportunity for fringe players with England’s World Cup squad rested but Jones has recently suggested that is no longer the case in light of the enforced break. He will have guaranteed access to England players for the rearranged Six Nations match against Italy but it may need to be negotiated for rescheduled summer tours.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"2afc9aa3f1de9836f21b7203f9b6fac301ca86b0\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2afc9aa3f1de9836f21b7203f9b6fac301ca86b0/0_48_3339_2003/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The Covid-19 outbreak has forced coach Eddie Jones into a rethink for England’s Japan tour.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Covid-19 outbreak has forced coach Eddie Jones into a rethink for England’s Japan tour.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Andy Buchanan/AFP via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>“The situation is hypothetical,” said an RFU spokesperson. “As you would expect the RFU is talking to all parties to consider every possibility in the best interests of players and fans.

Sweeney added: “[The players] are a very reasonable bunch of people. The executive team and Eddie himself have taken cuts which are in excess of 25%.”</p>',\n",

The club said their manager, Ralph Hasenhüttl, senior coaching staff and board of directors would also defer some of their pay for the next three months.</p> <p>It is understood Southampton’s chief executive, Martin Semmens, played a leading role in the talks, coordinating a plan between the players and the club’s owners, the Gao family and Katharina Liebherr.</p> <p>The economic consequences of the suspension of English football were laid bare to the players and the agreement, believed to have the backing of the Professional Footballers’ Association, enables Southampton to commit to not furloughing staff until the end of June.</p> <p>It represents a significant breakthrough in the pay dispute between top-flight players and owners since the postponement of the season. Although Premier League clubs could lose £1.137bn if the season is cancelled, they have found it difficult to convince players to lower their pay.</p> <p>Attempts to reach an agreement over potential 30% reductions across the league reached a dead end last weekend, forcing clubs to go it alone. The PFA has stood in the way of sweeping cuts, arguing they would <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/apr/08/would-a-premier-league-pay-cut-really-cost-the-government-200m\" title=\"\">cause a £200m tax deficit</a> and hurt the NHS.</p> <p>However, players are keen to contribute to society – it was announced on Wednesday that Premier League captains had <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/apr/08/premier-league-captains-close-to-launching-charitable-fund-after-talks\" title=\"\">launched a charitable fund</a>, #PlayersTogether, to help people involved in tackling the pandemic – and they have also wanted clubs to make clear why wage drops are necessary.</p> <p>West Ham have explained their financial situation to the players, who are discussing whether to defer pay. The captain, Mark Noble, will play a big role in representing the squad.</p> <p>West Ham’s manager, David Moyes, has <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/apr/06/west-ham-manager-david-moyes-takes-voluntary-30-per-cent-pay-cut-coronavirus\" title=\"\">taken a 30% pay cut</a> and the club intend to raise at least £30m through a rights issue next month. The vice-chair, Karren Brady, has also taken a 30% pay cut to ensure that full-time and casual staff continue to be paid in full.</p> <p>Brighton’s chief executive, Paul Barber, said the club’s financial situation had been set out to the players and he is hopeful they will assist by accepting a salary drop. “What we have said is if we can take a cut on wages to reduce the loss of matchday income, that would be a significant help to us,” he said. “If, on the other hand, at some stage in the future we recover that matchday income by playing those matches in front of a crowd, then we would simply return that money.”</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"The Fiver: sign up and get our daily football email.\">  <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/4163\" height=\"52\" data-form-title=\"Sign up for The Fiver\" data-form-description=\"Get our daily email on the world of football\" data-form-campaign-code=\"Fiver_signup_page\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\"></iframe> <figcaption>The Fiver: sign up and get our daily football email. </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Barber, the manager, Graham Potter, and the technical director, Dan Ashworth, have taken pay cuts.

Inspired by the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2020/mar/30/be-your-own-italian-masterpiece-how-people-are-recreating-classic-artworks-in-coronavirus-quarantine\">recent social media trend</a>, Jane, her husband Chris, their son Nick and daughter Amy – who are all in lockdown together – set themselves an Easter challenge to recreate a classic artwork using things they already had at home.</p> <p>To achieve the image, they took four separate shots in their back garden – changing costumes and poses between each – and then stitched the photos together digitally. “My husband kept saying: ‘We’ve got to be quick because the light keeps changing.’ He was putting us under loads of pressure. We were all wearing different bits of sheet and he was saying ‘Come on, get changed!’ and we’d say ‘Where’s my arm supposed to be? Where am I looking?’ … You’d probably only do it in a lockdown.” </p> <p>As people across the UK must continue to stay at home because of the coronavirus, we asked Guardian readers how they are planning to celebrate Easter in lockdown.</p> <p>Dozens of churchgoers told us that they had discovered new ways to worship together, and will be tuning into online services and prayer meetings.</p> <p>A group called <a href=\"http://www.studentcross.org.uk/\">Student Cross</a> has adapted its annual pilgrimage to the Anglican and Roman Catholic shrines in Little Walsingham, Norfolk. “We normally walk in 11 different groups, carrying a cross and stopping to share refreshment and reflections with those we meet,” says Laura Mitcham.</p> <p>But with the pilgrimage cancelled this year, participants can instead go online to log their steps from walking around their home or local area as part of their daily exercise, as well as taking part in daily Zoom liturgy services. “It’s not the same as the physical pilgrimage, says Mitcham, “but it’s something special that will be remembered due to its unique nature and the way the community has pulled together.”</p> <p>Many people across the country are baking hot cross buns and Simnel cakes, decorating houses with homemade ornaments, and organising indoor Easter egg hunts.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"ca8764f5ac8dc341d4e44107606749acc226df74\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ca8764f5ac8dc341d4e44107606749acc226df74/196_308_1262_1578/800.jpg\" alt=\"Bethany Acres, 7, from Bradford-upon-Avon, made these Easter rabbits out of leftover cardboard to wish people passing their house a Happy Easter.\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Bethany Acres, 7, from Bradford-upon-Avon, made these Easter rabbits out of leftover cardboard to wish people passing their house a Happy Easter.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Rachel Acres</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>“My daughter absolutely loves rabbits so Easter is her favourite time of year,” says Rachel Acres from Bradford-on-Avon. On Thursday, she and Bethany, seven, dug out leftover cardboard from their garage to make into giant rabbits and decorate their front garden “to wish all passers-by a happy Easter”.</p> <p>In Cornwall, Sarah Parmenter is staging a mini-festival for her four-year-old son who has loved doing Easter egg hunts with his cousins and friends in previous years. “The bunting will be out, magical Easter egg plants will have grown in the garden and of course the bunny will have visited – apparently he has a special sleigh which allows him to comply with social distancing requirements,” says Parmenter. “We already have an Easter tree decorated with a special sign, reminding the bunny to stop here.”<br><br>For Millie Jones and her housemates, this weekend marks not only Easter but also the end of their two-week self-quarantine after one started showing symptoms. To celebrate, they’ll have “a very tame blowout” and recreate a typical Christmas day: Bucks Fizz and croissants in the morning, films and chocolate in the afternoon, then a huge roast dinner.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"820b00de602fcb72834285d4d02d9c2ddb7a4f2f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/820b00de602fcb72834285d4d02d9c2ddb7a4f2f/0_0_3024_3203/944.jpg\" alt=\"Sarah Parmenter and her four-year-old son created this Easter tree to remind the Easter bunny to stop at their house.\" width=\"944\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Sarah Parmenter and her four-year-old son created this Easter tree to remind the Easter bunny to stop at their house</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: SarahParmenter</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>“We want to make it as fun as possible,” says Jones. “It feels like we’re all living in the week between Christmas and New Year anyway, so we want to create a festive day, celebrating each other, in this time of lockdown.”</p> <p>Rik Sterken and his family had planned to spend a few nights on the Welsh coast this weekend. Instead, they’re taking a mini-camping trip into their back garden. “We reckon the tent just about fits,” says Sterken. “We’re trying to keep a sense of normality but also a sense of adventure as well.”</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Callout callout-coronavirus\">  <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div data-callout-tagname=&quot;callout-coronavirus&quot;&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Callout&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;callout-coronavirus&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>On Friday night, Sterken, his wife and two children will eat pizzas from their home-built, wood-fired pizza oven for the first time this year, and enjoy barbecued bacon butties on Saturday morning. “The kids are really excited, although we haven’t told them yet they’ll be sleeping on camping mats,” he says.</p> <p>And unable to go to France on holiday, Crista Hazell and her husband Jon will be donning rabbit ears and painting on whiskers to be the Easter bunny for their older neighbours.</p> <p>“We know they can’t see their families so thought we’d help them find a smile on Sunday by placing a few Easter eggs (with clean hands) on doorsteps before the sun rises,” says Crista, an author and education consultant from Bristol. “It’s something a bit daft, but hopefully we can give them a little love and enjoyment.”</p>',\n",

       "   'body': '<p>It’s hard to write music during lockdown. A lot of songwriters I’ve spoken to just aren’t getting inspired at the moment. I did try. I wrote a song called Wash Your Hands and thought: “I’d better put the guitar down now.” That’s why I decided to start hosting listening parties on Twitter instead, which I’ve been doing every night from 9pm with the hashtag <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/timstwitterlisteningparties?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Ehashtag\">#timstwitterlisteningparties</a>. We pick an album and listen together at a set time – 9pm or 10pm – with commentary from one of the artists involved.</p> <p>The first week I did it we had Blur, Ride, Franz Ferdinand and Oasis – <a href=\"https://twitter.com/BoneheadsPage?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor\">Bonehead</a> did the commentary for that one. As soon as we started, it had become a thing. One of the maddest things was seeing it as the top trend on Twitter.</p> <p>Everyone who’s taken part so far has said it’s like doing a gig. There’s the trepidation beforehand, then an hour of craziness, and finally a period where you’re kind of decompressing. The only difference with this is that nobody’s nicking your beers!</p> <p>We’ve done about 30 so far, including our debut album <a href=\"https://www.discogs.com/The-Charlatans-Some-Friendly/master/12876\">Some Friendly</a>, and there have been some great moments. My personal highlight is me not realising that I’d played Reading festival in 1999 – I still can’t remember it now, even though people have been telling me exactly what happened.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2016/may/28/tim-burgess-my-life-before-was-sky-high-these-days-its-real-and-natural\">Tim Burgess: ‘My life before was sky high. These days it’s real’</a> </p> </aside>  <p>I also loved Dave Rowntree revealing his collection of laminated artefacts from the Parklife era – old photos, gig tickets. He made so much effort and that really upped everything because the listening party became a visual thing. The Cribs did one for Men’s Needs, Women’s Needs, Whatever and were showing their old tour diaries and lyric sheets. Those are the kind of insights you don’t often get in a magazine – bands probably wouldn’t want to show those at the time of release anyway, but now there’s a bit of history involved and they feel more relaxed.</p> <p>What I like is that it’s giving people the opportunity to listen to an album in its entirety again. Musicians I talk to, even the younger artists, all want to make an album that’s a masterpiece, that has a theme running through it, a start and a finish. That has been crushed in a way because people felt they didn’t have enough time on their hands. But now all we have is time, so it’s a beautiful thing for this moment.</p> <p>We’ve had listeners from all over: New Zealand, Japan and even Antarctica. Part of the reason we do them at 10pm is because that’s when Japan is waking up. The other reason is because that’s when the 10 o’clock news is on, and I wanted people to have an alternative to that – you can watch the news at any time these days; this is a way of offering up an alternative good time instead.</p> <p>It’s not the only thing I’m doing at the moment. I’ve got a new solo album, I Love the New Sky, coming out in May. I spoke to the label about whether we should postpone it, but we agreed it was a good time to put music out, to have something to look forward to. I’ve also been doing some home schooling with my six-year-old. But I’m not a teacher and I don’t think I should try to be. Instead we just go for a walk every day and talk about volcanoes, tornadoes, the coronavirus and the environment. That’s not a bad start, is it? He’s also got into wrestling, so we do a bit of that.</p> <p>But most of my time is spent on these listening parties. I’m always working on them. All day I’m getting direct messages and emails and I’m normally up until midnight answering questions. The listening party itself keeps you on your toes. I usually have a few tweets lined up beforehand – that way I can answer everyone’s questions while it’s live. It’s hard to keep up. There’s so many people out there saying things like “where are we now?” and I have to be on hand to say “two minutes and 34 seconds into track four ... no, it’s two minutes and 36 seconds now!”</p> <p>It’s growing every day. We could keep this going until Christmas. Sleaford Mods have just said they want to do all of their albums, every Thursday at 8pm.

Fortunately, if you’re missing the competitive zeal of live sports, multiplayer games such as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/games/2019/sep/25/fifa-20-review-not-your-typical-annual-update\">Fifa 20</a> enable fans to create their own tournaments – providing both distraction therapy, and the chance to beat your sister to the Premier League title. Here are five recommended multiplayer sports sims, and how to set them up for fierce, sofa-based competition.</p> <h2><a href=\"https://www.ea.com/en-gb/games/fifa/fifa-20\">Fifa 20</a> (PS4, Xbox One; £29.99)</h2> <p>One of Fifa’s great strengths is its options for offline tournament play. There are 63 competitions included, such as the English FA Cup and German DFB-Pokal. If you live with 19 other people you can even set up an entire Premier League season, with every club human-controlled.</p> <p>Best of all is the Custom Tournament mode, where you and three (or seven!) additional family members can go head to head, using your choice of Fifa 20’s 700 teams. Flexible options include two-legged ties and the number of permitted substitutes, plus your choice of trophy and stadium for the final.</p> <p>There’s sadly no way to set up an online tournament alongside friends, although <a href=\"https://www.fifplay.com/fifa-20-co-op-seasons/\">Co-op Seasons</a> is a fine alternative. Here you team with a mate against similar tandems, with a system of 10 divisions ensuring you’re matched to opponents of equal ability. All results count towards a global leaderboard.</p> <h2><a href=\"https://www.playstation.com/en-us/games/mlb-the-show-20-ps4/\">MLB The Show 20</a> (PS4; £44.99)</h2> <p>The best choice for a living room baseball tournament that won’t threaten your double glazing is The Show’s excellent Home Run Derby mode. It’s available for two, four or eight players, with the simple aim of scoring more homers than your opponent to progress.</p> <p>The Show features fully licensed players from all 30 MLB clubs, and you can set tournament brackets to feature any of these. There are various time limits, but three minutes feels optimal, particularly when factoring in a cool additional feature: hit two home runs longer than 440 feet and you score a 30-second bonus.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"0e201485e476abc638ff84e565ce1140fc1f4008\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0e201485e476abc638ff84e565ce1140fc1f4008/0_0_3600_2160/1000.jpg\" alt=\"MLB The Show 20\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Best living-room baseball ...

In real life, anyway: AO2 enables you to play out the tournament and declare your own victor. While The Championships aren’t officially licensed, the game’s “London” stadium and the “Large Gold 4” and “Medium Silver 17” trophies are clearly inspired by the biggest event on the tennis calendar. <br> It’s slightly more complex than the other games listed here as custom tournaments require at least eight players, but there’s an easy way to offset this: simply start your competition, then simulate the entire quarter-finals round. You’re now set for four-way action featuring your pick of Rafael Nadal, Gaël Monfils, Ash Barty, Johanna Konta and more.</p> <p>If you have a few younger players in your household, Mario Tennis Aces (Nintendo Switch) is a lot of fun and allows four-player matches, and it’s portable so you can take it out into the garden.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"9045f3f7e47f09b7ca1705736ac7881708c50adc\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9045f3f7e47f09b7ca1705736ac7881708c50adc/501_79_3339_2003/1000.jpg\" alt=\"AO Tennis 2\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Play out your favourite tournament ...

That’s purely down to its offline excellence. While PGA’s lack of online options disappointed, sofa-based play is of a pass-the-pad nature that immaculately apes the series’ Mega Drive roots.</p> <p>Up to four players compete over 12 courses, the pick of which is Paracel Storm: a preposterous yet brilliant 18-hole round based on Battlefield 4. Stick-swinging controls suit players of all ages, but Sega alumni can make use of a classic three-tap technique if so preferred.</p> <p>If you have trouble getting a copy, serious players might want to try <a href=\"https://thegolfclubgame.com/\">The Golf Club 2019</a>, which aims to be a very accurate simulation of the sport. More accessible alternatives include the long-running cartoon-style favourite <a href=\"https://www.playstation.com/en-gb/games/everybodys-golf-ps4/\">Everybody’s Golf </a>(PS4) or the incredibly hectic <a href=\"https://partygolfgame.com/\">Party Golf</a> (PC, PS4, Xbox One, Nintendo Switch), currently just £2 on Switch.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a0ed54c62703a96129399f4e47517b2bd8228457\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a0ed54c62703a96129399f4e47517b2bd8228457/66_0_1800_1080/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Rory McIlroy PGA Tour Golf\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Cult following ...

In addition to setting up offline tournaments, you can create online competitions too. Up to 35 friends can join you in playing out a real NBA season with six expansion teams, or a created one that mixes classic rosters with contemporary ones.</p> <p>If you’d rather stick to home-bound b-ball, the offline Playoffs mode is the way to go: a straight knockout tournament where up to 16 players can be user-controlled. Again, set-up options are plentiful, including a fantasy draft option in case you’re desperate to make Giannis Antetokounmpo a Brooklyn Net.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"0f3bfdbbb5487d09db577550d69f9c9f1172a20c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0f3bfdbbb5487d09db577550d69f9c9f1172a20c/55_0_902_541/500.jpg\" alt=\"NBA 2K20\" width=\"500\" height=\"300\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Home-bound b-ball ...

       "   'body': '<p>Much has been made of the Football Association’s 50-year ban from 1921 on female players using its affiliated pitches, which scythed down the women’s game just as its growth had accelerated, with matches attracting attendances in excess of 50,000. Little, though, has been said of the eventual lifting of the ban in 1971, or of the man who authored the letter rescinding it. Now, the University of Nottingham is set to induct posthumously Sir Denis Follows – the then secretary of the FA and an alumnus – into its Sport Hall of Fame.</p> <p>The uncovering of the small but critical role of Follows, who died in 1983 aged 75, in the development of women’s football – which later led to him being named honorary life vice-president of the Women’s Football Association – happened by chance. Follows’s daughter, Maggie Ferris – another Nottingham alumnus – mentioned her father in a routine fundraising phone call with the university.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"12e3dea5f5f46db546c8869e07537ea9cf234a93\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/12e3dea5f5f46db546c8869e07537ea9cf234a93/112_0_1141_1426/800.jpg\" alt=\"Sir Denis Follows’ daughter, Margaret Ferris.\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Sir Denis Follows’ daughter, Margaret Ferris.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: No credit</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The student that jotted down a few notes from their call took them away and soon afterwards the university and Ferris began to explore the history of a man who had a firm belief in equality and a person’s right to play sport and felt the lifting of the ban was natural. “He was always campaigning about things,” explains Ferris. “That was just part of what he was. And he was quite self-effacing, he never made a big deal of any achievement. Well, he was pretty pleased about winning the World Cup,” she adds with a chuckle.</p> <p>Follows was FA secretary in 1966. He introduced the idea of the first mascot for a finals – World Cup Willie – and separated the tournament’s organising committee, for which his daughter worked in the holidays, from the everyday running of the FA. He also presided over the loss of the Jules Rimet trophy, when it was stolen from a stamp exhibition, and subsequent recovery.</p> <p>“Dad brought it home [after it had been recovered] and he actually slept with it under the bed until we won it,” recalls Ferris. “And then it went to a special place to be displayed. When it was due to be taken to Mexico for the 1970 World Cup there was a real issue of how they were going to get it there.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"a3e1d19b70e1feb53b15b462724e1a28b99f0b78\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a3e1d19b70e1feb53b15b462724e1a28b99f0b78/0_0_1931_2506/771.jpg\" alt=\"Sir Denis Follows outside the FA headquarters with World Cup Willie, the 1966 World Cup mascot.\" width=\"771\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Sir Denis Follows outside the FA headquarters with World Cup Willie, the 1966 World Cup mascot.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: No credit</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>“The Jules Rimet cup was fabulous, it was absolutely beautiful. I’ve got a photo of my mum in our back garden holding it with our dog. Anyway, he decided that the best way to get it to Mexico was in his briefcase, so he just carried his briefcase all the time. In that way he was quite practical. It worked. First it was under the bed, then in his briefcase.”</p> <p>When Nobby Stiles’ contact lenses went missing, it was Ferris’s sister who went to an all-night Boots to get some more and Follows, who had connections with pilots as general secretary of the British Airline Pilots’ Association (Balpa), who arranged for them to be flown out to Stiles.</p> <p>Follows’ journey either side of 1966 is equally remarkable. Born in 1908, he started in student politics, becoming chairman of the University Athletics Union, representing the body on the FA council and being given the job of unpaid FA treasurer before becoming president of the National Union of Students.</p> <p>In those various posts he travelled in the 1930s to Latvia before it was invaded by the Soviet Union and to Madrid as Spain slid towards civil war in 1936, attending student conferences. “In a lot of domestic ways he was not capable at all,” says Ferris. “He could just about do tea and toast or boil an egg but in some ways he was a real innovator. He was in his treatment of women. I found an old photograph of a 1930s committee that he was on at the university and a third of the people in the photograph are women. He had always worked with women in an equivalent role, he never expected women to be the underdogs.”</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2020/mar/28/coe-and-ovetts-olympic-debt-to-bureaucrat-who-defied-thatcher\">Coe and Ovett\\'s Olympic debt to bureaucrat who defied Thatcher | Andy Bull</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Follows was partially blind in one eye and was therefore ruled out of national service during the second world war but still joined the RAF as a lecturer. After the war that enabled him to become general secretary of Balpa. Meanwhile he succeeded Sir Stanley Rous as secretary of the FA in 1962.</p> <p>His dual career paths gave him a unique role in the Munich air disaster in 1958. “When there was the the crash with the Busby Babes in it Dad was the general secretary of Balpa, but he was also treasurer of the FA,” explains Ferris. Follows became the union representative of the pilot, Captain James Thain, who was initially blamed for the crash, and spent more than a decade working on the case to clear his name. “Initially he was a scapegoat, guilty [of failing] to clear the ice on the wings despite witnesses saying there was no ice, but Dad got him cleared in 1968,” says Ferris.</p> <p>Three years later Follows drafted the letter that would lift the ban on women’s football. “I knew about it being reversed,” says Ferris, “but I didn’t know about the ban [coming into force] in the 20s. I just knew that there wasn’t any women’s football and accepted that as the status quo.”</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"283e74b223bf00c2b3167e4a11de7ff81687c29e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/283e74b223bf00c2b3167e4a11de7ff81687c29e/84_877_4490_3887/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Players from Southampton Women line up in 1971, one year after the club was founded.

It was traumatic. But he seemed pretty calm at the time, he just dealt with the complaints and just quietly said that, in his opinion, it was an individual decision and that the opportunity should be there for the athletes to participate. It was Lord Carrington [the foreign secretary] and Michael Heseltine [head of the Department for the Environment, which included sport] that were ringing him and putting the heavy screws on but he just stuck by his guns.</p> <p>“Of course it was Seb Coe’s gold medal that year,” she adds. “And he has said himself, I believe, that if it hadn’t been for my father he probably would have never won a gold medal.” Instead, with government funding cut, Follows travelled the length and breadth of the country “trying to raise money for the Olympics, because he was just so desperate for them to be able to do what they wanted to do, without government money at all. And he did it.”</p> <p>His hall of fame induction is on hold due to the coronavirus crisis, but Nottingham’s head of sport, Dan Tilley, is looking forward to recognising his “affinity for student sport, the connection to the university, the fact that he has achieved a huge amount in his career”.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"The Fiver: sign up and get our daily football email.\">  <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/4163\" height=\"52\" data-form-title=\"Sign up for The Fiver\" data-form-description=\"Get our daily email on the world of football\" data-form-campaign-code=\"Fiver_signup_page\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\"></iframe> <figcaption>The Fiver: sign up and get our daily football email. </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Tilley says: “It feels only right that we celebrate him.

Sometimes sports administrators get overlooked, and actually some of the things they do are quite significant.”</p>',\n",

As the outbreak <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/ng-interactive/2020/apr/08/coronavirus-100-days-that-changed-the-world\">passed the 100-day mark</a> and many countries extended their lockdowns, others moved to relax restrictions wary that cases may take off again.</p> \\n<h2><strong>Scientists shed light on </strong><strong>immune response to coronavirus</strong></h2> \\n<p>On Monday, a team at Fudan University in Shanghai <a href=\"https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.30.20047365v1\">reported the first detailed analysis</a> of the immune response in patients with coronavirus. Tests on the blood of 175 patients who had been discharged from hospitals in Shanghai revealed that neutralising antibodies – those that can wipe out the virus – usually arose 10 to 15 days after the onset of illness and targeted three different parts of the “spike” protein on the virus’s surface.</p> \\n<p>While older patients produced the highest levels of neutralising antibodies, many patients had low levels and 10 did not appear to generate them at all. If the findings hold up – the study has yet to be reviewed and published – they have widespread implications. The more robust immune response from older people suggests their blood plasma may work best in trials that are assessing whether <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2020/mar/29/coronavirus-survivors-blood-plasma-could-be-used-to-fight-infection\">convalescent plasma</a> infusions can help seriously ill patients overcome the virus. But the findings may frustrate <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2020/apr/08/health-minister-defends-uk-coronavirus-testing-approach-chris-whitty-germany-covid-19\">efforts to manufacture an accurate antibody test</a> for the virus if many people have low or even non-existent levels of neutralising antibodies. This week it emerged that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/09/uk-government-urged-to-abandon-poor-finger-prick-antibody-tests-coronavirus\">none of the antibody tests</a> purchased by the UK government were good enough to roll out.</p> \\n<p>The work also has implications for<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/30/immunity-passports-could-speed-up-return-to-work-after-covid-19\"> “immunity passports”</a>, which could allow people to return to normal life if blood tests showed they had developed immunity to the virus. Nearly 6% of the recovered patients had no neutralising antibodies, suggesting that other parts of the immune system had cleared the infection, without producing long-term immunity.</p> \\n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"ba9786c6-c779-4063-8bf9-1d3009eb7c70\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \\n  <div>\\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/3qV7R2iYVXg?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\\n  </div>\\n </gu-atom> \\n</figure> \\n<h2><strong>Not everyone agrees on wearing face masks</strong></h2> \\n<p>Whether or not to don a face mask in public became a matter of debate and confusion. After a <a href=\"https://www.who.int/publications-detail/advice-on-the-use-of-masks-in-the-community-during-home-care-and-in-healthcare-settings-in-the-context-of-the-novel-coronavirus-(2019-ncov)-outbreak\">review of new evidence</a>, the World Health Organization maintained its view on Monday that while people who have cough, fever and difficulty breathing should wear a mask and seek medical help, there was no need for healthy people to wear face masks in public. The organisation conceded that people without symptoms can spread the virus, but only recommended healthy people wear face masks when they were caring for a coronavirus patient and in the same room. The masks can help prevent infections by catching large virus-laden droplets that are expelled from patients when they cough and sneeze, but <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/apr/03/face-masks-coronavirus-scientists-evidence-covid-19-public\">David Heymann</a>, who chairs the WHO’s risk committee, said face masks can give people a false sense of security if they do not combine an effective one with eye protection and adopt strict hand hygiene measures.</p> \\n<p>The UK has a similar stance to the WHO and does not recommend healthy people wear masks in public. But the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) not only <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/prevent-getting-sick/cloth-face-cover.html\">advises people to wear face masks</a> outside, but offers guidance on how to make “cloth face coverings” too. On Tuesday, US government scientists argued the case for face coverings after <a href=\"https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.02.20051177v1\">preliminary research</a> showed people spray out thousands of tiny saliva droplets when they speak simple sentences such as “stay healthy”. Adriaan Bax at the US National Institutes of Health, who led the work, found a damp homemade cloth face mask “dramatically reduced droplet excretion”.</p> \\n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"a81dbd86-f7c7-4b2d-affa-9a6aff9b9b5f\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \\n  <div>\\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/4xFY3aPF7E4?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\\n  </div>\\n </gu-atom> \\n</figure> \\n<h2><strong>Some countries look towards easing </strong><strong>lockdowns</strong></h2> \\n<p>Following in the footsteps of China, a number of countries announced plans to relax restrictions they had put in place to stop the spread of the virus. On Wednesday, China, lifted its 11-week lockdown in Wuhan where the outbreak began. The following day, the Czech Republic allowed bicycle shops and DIY, hobby and hardware stores to reopen. After the Easter break, Austria will let small shops, DIY stores and garden centres return to business, while Denmark plans to reopen kindergartens and primary schools. But with the virus still present and large numbers of people still vulnerable to infection, health officials are watching closely for cases to surge again. As Denmark’s prime minister, Metter Frederiksen, commented: “It’s like walking a tightrope.”</p> \\n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \\n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/gallery/2020/apr/08/wuhan-ends-coronavirus-lockdown-in-pictures\">Wuhan ends coronavirus lockdown – in pictures</a> </p> \\n</aside> \\n<p>The British prime minister, Boris Johnson, was admitted to intensive care for several days but <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global/2020/apr/09/boris-johnson-moved-from-intensive-care-but-stays-in-hospital\">returned to a ward on Thursday</a> after he improved without needing mechanical ventilation. In his absence, the foreign secretary, Dominic Raab, scotched hopes for an early end to the UK lockdown and refused to be drawn on exit strategies until the country was beyond the peak of the epidemic. But discussions are underway in Whitehall where options range from a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2020/apr/09/lifting-lockdown-uk-options-graded-return-normality\">“youth first”</a> policy that would allow young workers to return to their jobs, to a staggered <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/apr/09/uk-lockdown-could-end-with-sector-by-sector-plan-for-firms\">sector-by-sector approach</a>.

President Trump imposed restrictions on travellers from China at the end of January but only blocked travel from most European countries in mid-March. Separate teams at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai in New York City and New York University reached similar conclusions after studying the genetic code of viruses obtained from patients in the region. The scientists traced the origins of the outbreak by analysing patterns of mutations that accumulate in viruses as they spread. “The majority is clearly European,” Harm van Bakel, a geneticist from one of the teams, told the <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/08/science/new-york-coronavirus-cases-europe-genomes.html\">New York Times</a>. The same approach was used last month to trace the coronavirus back to <a href=\"https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.30.015008v1\">infected bats</a>.</p> \\n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \\n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/ng-interactive/2020/apr/09/how-coronavirus-spread-across-the-globe-visualised\">How coronavirus spread across the globe - visualised</a> </p> \\n</aside> \\n<h2><strong>And finally…</strong></h2> \\n<p>As streets emptied out and factories closed their doors, scientists at the British Geological Survey noticed their sensitive earthquake-detecting seismometers had stopped twitching as much. Closer inspection of the charts revealed that the lockdown has changed how the Earth moves beneath our feet: there are fewer vibrations from human noise passing through the planet.</p> \\n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \\n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/09/climate-crisis-amid-coronavirus-lockdown-nature-bounces-back-but-for-how-long\">Climate crisis: in coronavirus lockdown, nature bounces back – but for how long?</a> </p> \\n</aside> \\n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2020/apr/06/lockdown-has-cut-britains-vibrations-seismologists-find\">fall in background noise</a>, particularly around urban seismometers, has left scientists wondering if they might detect earthquakes that are smaller than normal, or at distances that are normally beyond their range. With lockdowns easing around the world, they do not have long to look. As Brian Baptie at the BGS conceded: “We may not get anything in the short term.”</p>',\n",

       "   'body': '<p>As the daughter of an air force officer and a nurse, I am fascinated by defence systems. There is none more impressive than the human immune system, equipped as it is with a rich arsenal to defend against different types of pathogen. Viruses have evolved to trick, bypass and evade these defences. Our immune systems have, in turn, learned to recognise and deter these virus stealth tactics. In Covid-19, the enemy is a tiny piece of genetic material wearing a lipid coat and a protein crown.</p> <p>So how is our immune system able to defend against viral infections, and how does this apply to Covid-19? The virus that causes Covid-19 is called severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (Sars-Cov-2), and was first detected in humans around five months ago. It is a coronavirus. “Corona”, in Latin, means crown. The virus is adorned with an outer layer of protein covered in spikes, like a crown. These spikes help the virus attach itself to target cells. The research community is<strong> </strong>fast learning about immunity to Covid-19, and we are also applying our knowledge of similar respiratory viruses to predict what to expect in this infection.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Importantly, Covid-19 cannot gain entry to our homes or bodies by itself – we have to let it in</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Think of a virus as a robot; it cannot reproduce so it needs a factory of materials – proteins, lipids and nucleotides –<strong> </strong>to build copies of itself. The coat allows the virus to attach itself to the target cell’s membrane. The virus then fuses with the cell and releases a<strong> </strong>shopping list of instructions<strong> </strong>on how to build and assemble new viruses. This shopping list, the virus genome, is written in nucleotides (RNA). The first job of a virus that enters our bodies is to invade target cells so that it can comfortably remove its coat and deploy its RNA.</p> <p>Once inside, the virus commandeers the cell and borrows cellular machinery<strong> </strong>to build more viruses before immune cells detect the intruders and raise the alarm. Antibody proteins that are able to stick to the virus-spike proteins, and prevent attachment to the target cells, are called neutralising antibodies: generating them is often the goal of protective vaccination.</p> <p>Our infected cells make the ultimate sacrifice and invite their own destruction by displaying distress signals for<strong> </strong>T-cells, which swiftly detect and kill them. T-cells are cytotoxic – powerful serial killers that can recognise peptide fragments of virus displayed on the infected cell surface. When they do, they release a payload of toxic enzymes that kill the infected cell in a “kiss of death”. This strategic martyrdom is organised by the immune system to deprive the virus of its replication factories and can lead to the reduction of viral load in the patient. It takes several days for antiviral T-cells to expand and antibodies to be generated. Here’s the silver lining<strong>:</strong> memory cells ensure that if we encounter the same virus again, we can react immediately with pre-existing defences. Sars-Cov-2 is new to humanity so we have no protective immunological memory. Vaccines prepared using harmless parts of the virus can help us build protective memory.</p> <p>The virus’s enemy superpower is spreading. The virus achieves this through “shedding” from infected patients. Sars-Cov-2 is expert at hopping from person to person, and in some people, it achieves a stealthy existence with mild or no symptoms. Once many copies of the virus are made, it needs to jump to another host. It hitches a ride on droplets that can be coughed or sneezed to a distance of up to two metres. Droplets can survive on surfaces for several hours enabling pick<strong>-</strong>up by a new host, or they can be directly inhaled if another person is in close proximity. Studies are emerging into <a href=\"https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2020/03/should-pets-be-tested-coronavirus\">animal hosts</a> – so far the virus has been detected in a few ferrets, cats, tigers and dogs. No animal deaths have yet been reported, and we don’t know if animals can transmit back to humans.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/21/coronavirus-vaccine-scientist-what-needs-to-be-done-now-hanneke-schuitemaker\">Vaccine scientist: ‘Everything is so new in dealing with this coronavirus’</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The age differential in fatalities for Covid-19 suggests, with some exceptions, that a healthy immune system is usually able to control infection. Meanwhile, an ageing or weakened immune system may struggle to deploy a protective arsenal. Importantly, Sars-Cov-2 cannot gain entry to our homes or bodies by itself – we have to let it in. This is why official advice has centred around<strong> </strong>cleaning our hands and avoiding touching our faces.</p> <p>We know that a healthy immune system is usually able to eliminate infection in a couple of weeks. However, we have no understanding of the components of our immune arsenal that contribute to this feat: some vaccines work by creating potent neutralising antibodies; other vaccines generate powerful memory T-cells. Antiviral antibodies emerge as early as three to four days after virus detection, but are they protective against future reinfection? We believe that antibodies to other coronaviruses (Sars, Mers) last from one to three years. Because this is a new virus, we don’t yet know the answer to this question. Public Health England is <a href=\"https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/878121/coronavirus-covid-19-testing-strategy.pdf\">recruiting</a> 16,000 to 20,000 volunteers to monitor antibodies once a month for six to 12 months to confirm whether we can generate long-lasting antibody responses to Sars-Cov-2. Determining the quality of these antibodies will be important to understanding long-term protection.</p> <p>What is our most potent immune weapon against Covid-19? <a href=\"https://twitter.com/bertoletti_lab/status/1247015473683632129\">Cytotoxic T-cells</a> may play an important role. Immunologists and virologists are working together to discover the correlates of protection, to design vaccines that offer long-term defences against Covid-19. Years of investment in research means that we can use existing approaches to respond to this new threat, and early mobilisation of research funders, philanthropists and academics are diverting resources to bolster these efforts on an unprecedented scale. Experience has taught us that vaccines are able to eradicate infections from this planet (for instance, smallpox), and medicines against viruses that don’t embed their genetic material to our own (for example, hepatitis C) can also achieve this.</p> <p>Our secret weapon is research. Scientists are working hard on understanding Covid-19, and collaboration is key to this effort. But until a vaccine or treatment is available, we ought to work hard to protect ourselves and our families: isolate and prevent transmission by using physical distancing, face masks and sensible hygiene. If we all do our part, this little virus holding the world to ransom won’t stand a chance.</p> <p>• Zania Stamataki is a senior lecturer and researcher in viral immunology at the University of Birmingham</p>',\n",

Like all the best epigrams, it is deeply wise, even if it overgeneralises. I can’t think of many instances from my own life where it isn’t true. A breakdown, a miscarriage, a job lost – they all led to better things.</p> <p>The phrase reminds me of something Winston Churchill supposedly said on losing the 1945 election. His wife apparently told him that defeat may well have been a blessing in disguise. “Madame, if this is a blessing, it is indeed well disguised,” he replied.</p> <p>And yet a blessing it was. Britain got Attlee, the welfare state, the NHS. Churchill got a rest, and then his swansong six years later. The rest is history.</p> <p>And so to the present.

       "   'body': '<p>Call centre staff at the NHS’s 111 helpline are turning up to work with coronavirus symptoms owing to a lack of adequate sick pay, according to a whistleblower who has filed a complaint to MPs.</p> <p>Concerns about health and safety have been raised by call handlers at at least three call centres where thousands of people are employed by outsourcing firms to field calls to the 111 service.</p> <p>One employee, whose complaint has been published by a commons select committee, told the Guardian that colleagues felt ill-prepared for the mass volume of calls and “terrified” they would catch the virus due to “unsafe” working conditions.</p> <p>The call-handler, who works for the outsourcing firm Teleperformance, said communal equipment including coffee machines, exit buttons and door handles were cleaned only twice a day – which the company does not dispute – and that staff were given only “very, very basic” training on how to handle 111 calls about the coronavirus.</p> <p>The government has asked some of the UK’s biggest private call centre operators to massively scale up their NHS 111 capacity amid a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2020/apr/05/calls-nhs-111-soar-400-since-start-coronavirus-crisis-uk\">400% increase in calls</a> due to the outbreak. Scores of often inexperienced staff have been hired in huge numbers in only a few days, posing challenges for the employees and companies involved.</p> <p>The call handler, who asked not to be named for fear of losing his job, said: “Managers, floorwalkers and staff have all been thrown into this with very, very basic training and there are a lot of situations that we aren’t prepared for.”</p> <p>The agency worker said staff with potential Covid-19 symptoms, such as a persistent cough, were coming into work as they could not afford to live on the statutory sick pay (SSP) of £96 a week: “There are lots of people coughing around the call centre who haven’t been self-isolating because there is no guarantee of our jobs being there when we come back… Most of us can’t survive on SSP.”</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Callout callout-coronavirus-key-workers\">  <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div data-callout-tagname=&quot;callout-coronavirus-key-workers&quot;&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Callout&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;callout-coronavirus-key-workers&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>Concerns have also been raised by staff at the Teleperformance’s offices in Manchester and <a href=\"https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/politics/fearful-scots-call-centre-staff-21769687\">in Scotland</a>. The French company, which is one of the government’s biggest call centre operators, said more than half of its nearly 7,000 call handlers were working from home and that the health, safety and security of its staff “has always been our top priority”. It said it had ordered hundreds of thousands of masks for employees and that cleaning of communal areas had increased from once a week to twice daily.</p> <p>Gary Slade, the company’s UK chief executive, said it was “fully compliant” with the government’s sick pay guidelines and that anyone who displayed Covid-19 symptoms was being sent home to self-isolate. “This is not about making money [or] treating people badly – we’ve never been that way,” he added. “But this is definitely without doubt our number one priority: do what’s right for our people and that’s what we’re doing.</p> <p>“Are we perfect? Probably not. There’s always room for improvement. But we’re doing everything we can, working as hard and as fast as we can.”</p> <p>The Guardian found several outsourcing firms recruiting NHS 111 operators for as little as <a href=\"https://www.reed.co.uk/jobs/111-call-handler/40211636?source=details.similarjobs\">£9.09 an hour</a> – barely above the UK minimum wage – despite their role as the first point of contact for people who think they have the coronavirus. One outsourcing firm <a href=\"https://www.reed.co.uk/jobs/home/view/40183565\">said</a> in its job advertisement that no previous customer service experience was needed, adding: “Your personality is far more important than your previous experience.”</p> <p>Concerns have been raised by NHS 111 operators at another firm, Sitel. The Labour MP Luke Pollard said he had received complaints from “dozens” of staff employed at the firm’s call centre in Plymouth, which is handling 111 calls. Staff told him they were working “desk to desk”, in breach of the coronavirus physical distancing rules, and that workplaces were not being deep-cleaned, leaving many afraid to go to work for fear of catching the virus.</p> <p>The company, which is owned by one of the world’s richest families, is said to have instructed call handlers not to speak to the media about their concerns. Pollard said: “If you’re scared of going to work, that is as real as it can get and that needs to be addressed.”</p> <p>Sitel declined to answer a series of questions when contacted by the Guardian. A spokeswoman confirmed that the company was in dialogue with Pollard and that it was following the safety measures outlined on <a href=\"https://www.sitel.com/covid-19-updates/\">its website</a>.</p>',\n",

       "   'body': '<p>If, like me, you have been confined to your home, glued to the news and nursing ever greater anxiety about the state of the world, you have probably become familiar with the sight of the World Health Organization’s director general, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, and his daily press briefings. Tedros, as he is known, is a calming presence in the midst of the crisis. Flanked by an international cast of scientists, he always seems confident that if we have hope, listen to the experts and pull together, we will get through this.</p> <p>Watching this reassuring spectacle, it is possible to imagine a world in which every nation respects the WHO’s authority, follows its advice and lets it coordinate the flow of information, resources and medical equipment across national boundaries to areas of greatest need.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/audio/2020/may/01/the-who-v-coronavirus-why-it-cant-handle-the-pandemic-podcast\">The WHO v coronavirus: why it can\\'t handle the pandemic – podcast</a> </p> </aside>  <p>That is not the world we live in. “The W.H.O. really blew it. For some reason, funded largely by the United States, yet very China centric,” <a href=\"https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1247540701291638787\" title=\"\">tweeted</a> Donald Trump on 7 April, summing up just one of the many lines of criticism the WHO is currently facing. It is not just Trump – even some of the WHO’s supporters in government, academia and NGOs argue that since the start of the coronavirus crisis, it has caved in to nationalist bullies, praised draconian quarantine measures and failed to protect the liberal international order of which it is a linchpin. “You’ve got a situation where it looks like WHO doesn’t want to exercise its authority,” said David Fidler, a fellow in global health at the Council on Foreign Relations and a regular consultant to the WHO.</p> <p>Meanwhile, the WHO is desperately struggling to get its 194 member states to actually follow its guidance. The WHO’s leaders are “very frustrated,” said John MacKenzie, a virologist and adviser on the WHO’s <a href=\"https://www.who.int/ihr/procedures/novel-coronavirus-2019/ec-22012020-members/en/\" title=\"\">emergency committee</a>. “The messages come out loud and clear, and some disregard the warnings. The US largely did, the UK largely did.”</p> <p>On 11 March, the day Tedros declared the coronavirus a pandemic, he spoke darkly of “alarming levels of inaction” from many countries. Pressed by journalists to name them, Mike Ryan, the usually no-nonsense Irish trauma doctor who heads the WHO’s Covid-19 response, demurred. “You know who you are,” he said, adding that “we don’t criticise our member states in public”.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"f5d9b5d69d079af3d45a26a68aba8a4108aca8e6\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f5d9b5d69d079af3d45a26a68aba8a4108aca8e6/0_100_4554_2732/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Donald Trump at a coronavirus task force briefing at the White House on April 08, 2020 in Washington, DC.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Donald Trump at a coronavirus task force briefing at the White House.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>There is a simple reason for this. For all the responsibility vested in the WHO, it has little power. Unlike international bodies such as the World Trade Organization, the WHO, which is a specialised body of the UN, has no ability to bind or sanction its members. Its annual operating budget, about $2bn in 2019, is smaller than that of many university hospitals, and split among a dizzying array of public health and research projects. The WHO is less like a military general or elected leader with a strong mandate, and more like an underpaid sports coach wary of “losing the dressing room”, who can only get their way by charming, grovelling, cajoling and occasionally pleading with the players to do as they say.</p> <p>The WHO “has been drained of power and resources”, said Richard Horton, editor of the influential medical journal the Lancet. “Its coordinating authority and capacity are weak. Its ability to direct an international response to a life-threatening epidemic is non-existent.”</p> <p>At the same time, the international order on which the WHO relies is fraying, as aggressive nationalism becomes normalised around the world. “All the previous rules about global norms, public health and understanding of what’s expected in terms of an outbreak has crumbled,” said Lawrence Gostin, director of the WHO Collaborating Center on National and Global Health Law. “None of us know where this is leading.”</p> <h2><strong>* * *</strong></h2> <p>The WHO was born during the moment of hopeful internationalism that followed the chaos of the second world war. The idea of global collaboration in fighting disease was not new – in the 19th century, at periodic International Sanitary Conferences, countries had standardised quarantine procedures for cholera and yellow fever – but the WHO constitution, adopted in 1948, envisioned a far grander global mission, nothing less than “the attainment by all people of the highest possible levels of health”.</p> <p>One of the WHO’s favourite success stories is the role it played in eliminating smallpox, a disease that was still killing millions each year in the 50s, despite the existence of a vaccine. Although the WHO worked on immunisation research, its most vital role was organisational and diplomatic. In 1959, it convinced the Soviet Union to manufacture 25 million vaccine doses, which the WHO would distribute. Not to be left behind, the US donated millions of dollars to vaccination programmes, both directly and through the WHO. By the late 60s, every nation in the UN was sending a detailed weekly report to WHO headquarters on their number of smallpox cases and recent progress. And in 1979, WHO declared smallpox eradicated, a first in world history. The WHO didn’t provide the most money, immunise the most people, or invent key technologies such as the <a href=\"https://www.globalhealthnow.org/object/bifurcated-needle\" title=\"\">bifurcated needle</a>, but it is hard to imagine smallpox having been defeated without it.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"4044c399a9a92c0ce5d57746c8e2d81421beb2e4\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4044c399a9a92c0ce5d57746c8e2d81421beb2e4/0_0_4252_2835/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Posters of WHO chief Tedros Adhanom in Sao Paulo, Brazil last week.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Posters of WHO chief Tedros Adhanom in Sao Paulo, Brazil last week.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Fernando Bizerra Jr/EPA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>If the story of smallpox eradication shows the WHO acting as something like an international ministry of public health, it doesn’t explain its current position as an emergency service, surveying the world for disease outbreaks and springing into action to contain them. That is a more recent addition to its portfolio, which came after a period, in the 80s and 90s, when the WHO seemed to be losing its earlier dynamism. The diseases it was partly created to address – smallpox, yellow fever and the plague – had either been eradicated or were in decline, and it was slow to identify new threats such as HIV/Aids. Under the leadership of Dr Hiroshi Nakajima, from 1988 to 1998, the organisation stagnated, and some member states complained about poor management and alleged petty corruption.</p> <p>Two things happened at the turn of the century that would shape the WHO we now see tackling the Covid-19 crisis. In 1998, the fiery former prime minister of Norway, Dr Gro Harlem Brundtland, was elected director general. And in 2002, a farmer in China’s Guangdong province became sick with a deadly, never-before-seen respiratory disease that quickly spread among the hospital staff who had treated him, and went on to become the first pandemic of the newly globalised 21st century: one that arose suddenly, had no treatment or cure, and spread with the speed and reach of international business.</p> <h2><strong>* * *</strong></h2> <p>Given the WHO’s sprawling structure, vague mandate and reliance on diplomacy, its director general holds immense power to shape it. Even before she took on the role, Brundtland was comfortable on the world stage. “I was already a political leader, and I was used to this kind of authority,” she told me. Like her friend Kofi Annan, the charismatic UN leader, Brundtland believed that international bodies should be prepared to lead when necessary, rather than being bossed around by powerful nations. “If the job is to direct and coordinate global health, it’s not a question of what one or several governments ask you to do,” she said. “We are working for humanity.”</p> <p>Brundtland pushed the WHO to use its local contacts, diplomatic channels and the emerging internet to locate potential outbreaks, all of which made the organisation less reliant on national governments for information. Within just a few years, this strategy proved its worth. In November 2002, when the Chinese government became aware of the first cases of a novel respiratory disease, later named Sars, it failed to alert the WHO. But, as part of Brundtland’s new approach, WHO staff were monitoring Chinese medical message boards and news media anyway, and were aware of what was then thought to be an atypical pneumonia outbreak. Adding to their suspicions, on 10 February 2003, David Heymann, who was then executive director of the WHO’s communicable diseases cluster, received an email from the son of a former WHO staff member in China warning of a “strange contagious disease” that had already killed 100 people, but which was “not allowed to be made known to the public”. The WHO took the information it had to China, which made its first official report to the WHO the next day.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"fc41769b862cdfb9d6ccd578b4bfef561615bef5\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/fc41769b862cdfb9d6ccd578b4bfef561615bef5/0_0_2000_1386/1000.jpg\" alt=\"WHO director-general Gro Harlem Brundtland (centre) gives polio immunisation to a young boy in New Delhi in January 2000.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"693\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">WHO director-general Gro Harlem Brundtland (centre) gives polio immunisation to a young boy in New Delhi in January 2000.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: John Mcconnico/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Although the WHO had no formal powers to monitor and censure its members, Brundtland wasn’t shy about doing so anyway. In the ensuing months she would accuse China of withholding information, claiming that the outbreak might have been contained “if the WHO had been able to help at an earlier stage” and exhorting the Chinese to “let us come in as quickly as possible!” With remarkable speed, China fell in line and shared its data with the WHO. “After her statements to China, no other countries hesitated,” said Heymann.</p> <p>In March 2003, as the disease spread – reaching Hong Kong, Vietnam and then Canada – for the first time in its history, the WHO issued <a href=\"https://www.who.int/mediacentre/news/releases/2003/pr23/en/\" title=\"\">advice against travelling</a> to affected areas. (Before then, the decision to advise on travel had always been left up to member states.) Despite having no formal powers to ground planes, the measures worked. “Passengers and flights dropped dramatically as soon as we issued the recommendations,” said Heymann.</p> <p>Brundtland’s approach was not always popular, and some bridled under this new upstart WHO. “It wasn’t just China,” Brundtland told me. “The mayor of Toronto [Mel Lastman] flew to Geneva to tell us take down the travel recommendation – while at the same time he was not containing the outbreak. He had people with Sars riding around the subway, no contact tracing, no following up. He couldn’t accept we were telling him what to do!”</p> <p>The WHO’s response to Sars was considered a huge success. Fewer than 1,000 people worldwide died of the disease, despite it reaching a total of 26 countries. The pandemic was defeated not with vaccines or medicines, but with NPIs, or “non-pharmaceutical interventions” in WHO parlance: travel warnings, tracking, testing and isolating cases, and a huge information-gathering operation across multiple countries, all made possible by the WHO’s willingness to wield authority that it had, in a sense, created simply by speaking it into existence. “Brundtland did things the WHO had no authority doing. She just did them,” said Fidler. “She sort of used Sars as a way to test drive some very radical changes.”</p> <p>“After Sars, the WHO’s position was essentially: that was great, let’s formalise it,” said Clare Wenham, a professor of global health policy at LSE. In 2005, the WHO drew up a new version of the <a href=\"https://www.who.int/ihr/about/en/\" title=\"\">International Health Regulations (IHR)</a>, the central legal document that all member states are bound by. According to Fidler, the updated IHR, which is in force to this day, is a radical document. It asks its members to prepare for public health threats according to standards set by the WHO, and to report any outbreaks and all subsequent developments. It also allows the WHO to declare a public health emergency of international concern (or PHEIC, pronounced, incredibly, “fake”), using its own information, over the objection of any single country. During an emergency, countries are expected to take the lead from the WHO’s guidelines and report any deviations to the organisation. All of these requirements, bar the reporting of outbreaks, were new.</p> <p>But the document stopped short of giving the WHO real power if states refuse to comply. “The WHO isn’t Nato, it’s not the security council,” said Gian Luca Burci, who was the WHO’s legal counsel until 2018. The US, fixated on bioterrorism after 9/11, supported giving the organisation some extended powers, but was opposed by Brazil, Russia, India and China, which were wary of US influence. There was a general reluctance to hand an international organisation any more power. “WHO members were happy with the actions that were taken during Sars, but there was definitely a sense afterward of ‘What if that was us in China’s spot?’,” explained Catherine Worsnop, a professor at the University of Maryland School of Public Policy. In short: thanks for stopping the pandemic, but we don’t want to be told what to do.</p> <h2><strong>* * *</strong></h2> <p>If the WHO has seemed at times weak or tentative – very un-Brundtland-like – in its handling of the coronavirus crisis, it is partly because of its bruising experiences during the past decade. From 2009 onwards, the WHO faced condemnation from the press and the international community for its handling of successive crises, all during a decade when the financial and diplomatic order that sustained it began to break down.</p> <p>First, there was the outbreak of H1N1, or “swine flu”. The novel influenza virus was discovered in Mexico in March 2009, and by June, when the WHO declared a pandemic, there were more than 28,000 cases in 74 countries. Over the next year, the WHO coordinated the global response – less aggressively than during Sars – and on 10 August 2010, it declared the pandemic over. Almost immediately, the WHO’s approach came under scrutiny. The death toll – 18,500 confirmed deaths worldwide – was far lower than initially expected, particularly given the disease reached more than 200 countries. “Suddenly you have people saying: ‘Wait a minute, you really cried wolf on this,’” says Wenham. The media and several prominent European politicians demanded inquiries as to whether the WHO had mistakenly rung the alarm, and “cost huge amounts of money and frightened people unnecessarily”, as Paul Flynn, the former Labour MP who chaired one of the inquiries, told the Times in 2010.</p> <p>To this day, opinions are split as to whether H1N1 was a crisis headed off, or a false alarm. “The WHO is always at risk of being criticised as doing too much or too little,” said Keiji Fukuda, the former WHO assistant director general who led the H1N1 response. Most of the former WHO staff and academics I spoke with agreed, proposing some version of the following as an iron law of public health: act slowly and you will be criticised for failing to stop preventable deaths; act aggressively and stop an outbreak before it becomes serious, and you will be accused of having overreacted. (After all, in the latter case, nothing too bad happened, so what was the big deal in the first place?)</p> <p>Fidler, who largely approves of WHO’s quick action during H1N1, believes that the backlash led the WHO, which was then under the command of director general Margaret Chan, to become too tentative about calling for action in the future. This was a period when the fallout from the 2008 financial crisis was also starting to take its toll on its budget. “There was a big funding shortfall,” said Andrew Cassels, director of strategy at the WHO between 2008 and 2013. “Cuts made to the emergency response programmes, personnel cuts.” The funding gap stood at nearly $300m in 2012. Entire offices were shut, including a team of social scientists working on pandemic response.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"29cfebe6451704d592d057ee78cfddfd9ae9f240\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/29cfebe6451704d592d057ee78cfddfd9ae9f240/0_0_3000_1800/1000.jpg\" alt=\"WHO staff training nurses to use protective gear in Freetown, Sierra Leone during the 2014 ebola outbreak.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">WHO staff training nurses to use protective gear in Freetown, Sierra Leone during the 2014 ebola outbreak.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Michael Duff/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>When the Ebola outbreak struck west Africa in 2014, the combination of the WHO’s greater caution and reduced budget resulted in disaster. In contrast to the previous pandemic, this time the WHO was slow to act, and was widely perceived to have lost control of the situation. In the end, the US and several other nations <a href=\"https://www.lshtm.ac.uk/newsevents/news/2015/foreign_military_response_crucial_to_ebola.html\" title=\"\">deployed</a> more than 5,000 military personnel at the request of the affected countries, and an ad-hoc UN committee was created to take over responsibilities from the WHO. The outbreak eventually killed 11,310 people, the vast majority in just three countries – Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone – paralysing their health systems for months, and causing panic across the world. Prominent scientists <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/nov/22/experts-criticise-world-health-organisation-who-delay-ebola-outbreak\" title=\"\">judged</a> the WHO’s response an “egregious failure”.</p> <p>Much of the blame fell on Chan herself. She appeared shell-shocked, stressing to the press that the WHO was a technical advisory body, and that it was national governments that had ultimate responsibility for their citizens’ health. “She wanted the WHO to be an apolitical agency – more like technical support. There was a hesitancy there to push the full powers of the WHO,” said Sara Davies, a professor of global health at Griffith University in Australia.</p> <p>The bold, proactive culture established after Sars had seemingly faded. Fidler believes that by delaying calling Ebola an emergency, and thus failing to organise an international response at a crucial moment, the WHO’s leadership had shown they “no longer had any faith in their authority”.</p> <h2><strong>* * *</strong></h2> <p>Today, under Tedros, the WHO finds itself in uncharted territory. Not only is it facing by far the biggest pandemic in its history, it is also having to defend itself from the nations on which it most depends. “In my 25-plus years of working on global health issues, I cannot recall the leader of a prominent developed country threatening to punish WHO in the manner President Trump did,” said Fidler, referring to the recent press conference in which Trump suggested putting “a very powerful hold” on US contributions to the WHO. In the same press conference, Trump accused the WHO of concealing information, being too slow to react to the virus, and, above all, showing favouritism towards China.</p> <p>Since the crisis began, Tedros has been repeatedly accused of being soft on China. Senator Marco Rubio recently <a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/politics/bolton-joins-calls-for-who-directors-resignation-accomplice-to-chinas-massive-coverup\" title=\"\">told</a> Fox News that the Chinese government had “used the WHO to mislead the world”, and claimed that the WHO “is either complicit or dangerously incompetent”. The US senator Rick Scott put it more bluntly, accusing the WHO of “helping Communist China cover up a global pandemic”. (Tedros, meanwhile, has warned of the dangers of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global/video/2020/apr/09/politicising-covid-19-like-playing-with-fire-who-director-general-says-after-trump-attack-video\">politicising the virus</a>.)</p> <p>Until very recently, the WHO was seen as a relatively neutral arena for China to extend its power. “China likes to find ways within the global system to give it a leading and benevolent image. The WHO was an uncontroversial place to do it,” said Rana Mitter, the director of the University of Oxford China Centre. No longer. The extent of the initial coverup is still unclear, but there is no question that at least at the local level, Chinese officials knew about the outbreak of a novel disease for weeks before it was reported to the WHO. During that time, Chinese doctors were prevented from speaking out.</p> <p>John MacKenzie, the WHO’s emergency committee adviser, told me that the organisation was “a little misled” about the Wuhan outbreak. He says that by the time the government alerted the WHO on 31 December, scientists in China had already determined via genome sequencing that the outbreak was caused by coronavirus. Yet the government didn’t confirm that until 7 January and the full genome sequence was not officially shared until 12 January. “That’s very slow,” MacKenzie told me. “For at least two weeks, we could have been making far more kits and so on for testing.” MacKenzie added that the number of cases officially declared by the Chinese in the first week – 59 in the week ending 5 January – was “nowhere near as many cases as you’d expect”. (The statistics released by the Chinese government continue to be questioned, with some <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/03/world/asia/coronavirus-china-grief-deaths.html?auth=login-email&amp;login=email\" title=\"\">reports</a> suggesting they may have seriously understated the number of coronavirus deaths.)</p> <p>Despite mounting frustrations – in mid-January, China also refused the WHO’s request to send a team of scientific observers to Hubei province, the centre of the outbreak – Tedros has never come close to doing what Brundtland did and calling China out. Instead, on 28 January, he had a closed-door meeting with Xi Jinping in Beijing, and two days later, he praised Chinese efforts to contain the disease, declaring that China is “setting a new standard for outbreak control”. That same day, 30 January, the WHO declared a Pheic, and began issuing prescriptions to countries around the world. On 8 February, China finally allowed WHO observers into the country. For Tedros’s supporters, this was vindication of his strategy of keeping China onside. For his critics, it was too little, too late.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"10a09ac53b686e3d6a7da5a1660151fdfce8847e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/10a09ac53b686e3d6a7da5a1660151fdfce8847e/0_177_3996_2398/1000.jpg\" alt=\"WHO director-general Adhanom Ghebreyesus with Chinese President Xi Jinping in Beijing on 28 January 2020.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">WHO director-general Adhanom Ghebreyesus with Chinese President Xi Jinping in Beijing on 28 January 2020.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Naohiko Hatta/AFP via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Elected as WHO director general in July 2017, Tedros was supported by a bloc of African and Asian countries, including China, which has considerable influence with those members. (Tedros is himself from Ethiopia, where he served as health minister and then foreign minister between 2005 and 2016.) It was a “really nasty” election, said Davies, in which the powers that have traditionally shaped the WHO, such as the US, UK and Canada, lent their support to one of Tedros’s rivals, the British doctor David Nabarro. During the campaign, Tedros was criticised for having served in a repressive government with a poor human rights record, and one of Nabarro’s backers even <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/may/23/who-elects-first-ever-african-director-general-after-tense-vote-tedros-adhanom-ghebreyesus\" title=\"\">accused</a> Tedros of covering up a cholera epidemic during his time as health minister. (Tedros <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/13/health/candidate-who-director-general-ethiopia-cholera-outbreaks.html\" title=\"\">denied the</a> claim, describing it as a “last-minute smear campaign”, while Nabarro told the New York Times that he had never authorised his team to make this accusation against Tedros.) In response, Tedros’s supporters mounted “a collective pushback”, said Davies, against the UK and its allies, eventually winning out. Tedros became the first director general from a so-called developing country since the Brazilian Dr Marcolino Gomes Candau in 1953.</p> <p>While his background is in politics, Tedros is not forthright or confrontational like Brundtland. In Ethiopia, his political party, the Tigray People’s Liberation Front (TPLF) was mostly comprised of ex-revolutionaries, men that “seemed carved out of a rock”, said Fantu Cheru, a professor at American University and former advisor to the Ethiopian government. Tedros was different – jovial and accessible, said Cheru, and able to make personal connections easily. “He is not very ideological, he believes he can work with anyone,” said Mehari Taddele Maru, a professor at the European University Institute in Florence, Italy. Cheru also sees Tedros as a pragmatist. “He’s not in the Chinese pocket. The Americans in particular wanted to destroy his image. Tedros knows how this game works. You need to have more allies than enemies, and those allies may not have a good track record.”</p> <p>“I don’t think Tedros did anything previous director generals would not have done,” said Anthony Costello, the director of the UCL Institute for Global Health. “He needed a good relationship with China in order to get in.” Even Lawrence Gostin, who has been a prominent critic of Tedros in the past, told me that “his high praise for China is understandable. He is seeking to coax China into cooperation.” He went on to note, though, that this strategy “does risk the credibility of WHO as an objective agency.”</p> <p>If the WHO thought it could sacrifice a bit of its credibility – overlooking China’s obvious blunders in December and January in exchange for its compliance in February – and move on, it was mistaken. The argument over China’s influence has been raging for weeks, not least since the government of Taiwan <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-coronavirus-taiwan/taiwan-says-who-ignored-its-coronavirus-questions-at-start-of-outbreak-idUSKBN21B160\" title=\"\">claimed</a> that the WHO had ignored its own early reports of human-to-human transmission of coronavirus as part of a larger history of appeasing China – which has blocked Taiwan from joining the WHO (and the UN) for decades.</p> <p>Now that Trump, scrambling for an answer to explain why the US now has <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/08/coronavirus-world-map-which-countries-have-most-cases-deaths-covid-19\" title=\"\">more cases</a> of coronavirus than any other nation, has alighted upon the WHO and China as his preferred scapegoats, these questions will not go away. “I don’t think we will see the US government cut off funding,” said Fidler. “But what’s happened with this pandemic – with the WHO caught between the US/China rivalry – is not a good omen for the WHO going forward.”</p> <h2><strong>* * *</strong></h2> <p>While the focus has been on what happened between China and the WHO in January, in epidemiological terms the crisis has moved on. Covid-19 has spread fastest and furthest in the US and Europe, through the very rich nations that largely fund and staff the WHO. Before the outbreak, the WHO struggled to get these same nations to prepare for future pandemics. Now the pandemic is here, and they are at the centre of the crisis, the WHO has been unable to keep them following its advice.</p> <p>Richard Horton of the Lancet said that after the WHO declared a public health emergency, “countries, especially western countries, didn’t listen. Or didn’t seek to understand what was actually taking place in China.” On 5 February, the WHO <a href=\"https://www.who.int/news-room/detail/05-02-2020-us-675-million-needed-for-new-coronavirus-preparedness-and-response-global-plan\" title=\"\">asked for</a> $675m to fund its Coronavirus response through to April. Anthony Costello of UCL said that when he met with Tedros on 4 March, the WHO had received only $1.2m. (Tedros announced last week that the funding goal had finally been reached, around the time the number of worldwide cases passed 1 million.)</p> <p>Even the decision to declare a pandemic on 13 March – a largely rhetorical distinction, since calling a Pheic already requires WHO members to respond – was calculated to wake its member states up. In the UK the Premier League was still playing games, and the previous week the US had held primary election contests. “They declared a pandemic because countries weren’t taking the advice,” said Adam Kamradt-Scott, a professor of global health at the University of Sydney.</p> <p>The WHO stresses that the ideal response to the crisis is relatively simple. Individual states should limit public exposure, especially by tracking and tracing all known cases – a strategy that worked in South Korea and appears to be working in Germany. On an international level, states should share scientific information and resources. These are the mantras Tedros goes back to in his briefings: “Test test test” and “solidarity solidarity solidarity”.</p> <p>But countries have repeatedly ignored WHO advice. In the UK, the response has been erratic, lurching between the WHO’s norms and its own strategies, such as the now-discredited pursuit of “herd immunity”. The US didn’t recommend school closures or avoiding travel until 16 March. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/05/sweden-prepares-to-tighten-coronavirus-measures-as-death-toll-climbs\" title=\"\">In Sweden</a>, restaurants are still open.</p> <p>Many wealthy nations have not only pursued their own national strategies for public health, but have also withdrawn from the globalised world of diplomacy and trade that they themselves set up. Earlier this year, for instance, the NHS <a href=\"https://www.euronews.com/2020/03/06/coronavirus-french-protective-mask-manufacturer-scraps-nhs-order-to-keep-masks-in-france\" title=\"\">ordered</a> millions of masks from a French company named Valmy SAS. But in early March, the French government requisitioned all masks produced within the country, so the masks never reached Britain. This week, Germany <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/03/mask-wars-coronavirus-outbidding-demand\" title=\"\">accused the US</a> of seizing a shipment of masks bound for Berlin from a port in Thailand; while Germany previously <a href=\"https://www.rheinische-anzeigenblaetter.de/region/bonn/beim-us-konzern-3m-zoll-kontrollierte-schutzmasken-und-schutzkleidung-36443358\" title=\"\">sent inspectors</a> to the factory of an American company in Jüchen to ensure their medical masks weren’t being exported against government orders.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/27/inside-the-race-to-develop-a-coronavirus-vaccine-covid-19\">\\'It’s a razor’s edge we’re walking\\': inside the race to develop a coronavirus vaccine</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The WHO is battling against a breakdown in international cooperation that is far beyond its capacity to control. “Governments have retreated to national policies, and this problem predates this crisis,” said Clare Wenham, the health scholar. States have been turning away from international institutions for a long time. The WHO hasn’t driven globalisation in the same way as the WTO or IMF, but in a way it has administered it – quietly promising to take on the outbreaks that arise in an industrialised and interconnected world, and relying on the often unspoken norms of international collaboration that underlie it.</p> <p>Ironically, it is most needed now, at a time when faith in the other administrators and overseers of the global order are in decline – a trend that Covid-19 only seems to be accelerating. “As it’s gone on, you see the WHO becoming less important,” said Wenham. “No one is thinking about reducing the global numbers, only their own. The WHO is a global force, but people aren’t thinking globally.”</p> <p>• Follow the Long Read on Twitter at <a href=\"https://twitter.com/gdnlongread\" title=\"\">@gdnlongread</a>, and sign up to the long read weekly email <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/info/ng-interactive/2017/may/05/sign-up-for-the-long-read-email\" title=\"\">here</a>.</p>',\n",

Even allowing for the overrepresentation of BAME staff in the NHS – <a href=\"https://www.ethnicity-facts-figures.service.gov.uk/workforce-and-business/workforce-diversity/nhs-workforce/latest\">they comprise 44% of medical staff</a> compared with 14% of the population of England and Wales – the fact that they were all from ethnic minorities was “extremely disturbing and worrying”, the BMA chair said.</p> \\n<p>“At face value, it seems hard to see how this can be random – to have the first 10 doctors of all being of BAME background,” Dr Chaand Nagpaul said. “Not only that, we also know that in terms of the BAME population, they make up about a third of those in intensive care. There’s a disproportionate percentage of BAME people getting ill.</p> \\n<p>“We have heard the virus does not discriminate between individuals but there’s no doubt there appears to be a manifest disproportionate severity of infection in BAME people and doctors. This has to be addressed – the government must act now.”</p> \\n<p>As well as the 10 doctors, three out of six nurses named as having died have also been BAME as was a hospital pharmacist and at least one healthcare assistant. The overall death figures in the UK have not been broken down by ethnicity but early research published this week showed that<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/07/bame-groups-hit-harder-covid-19-than-white-people-uk\"> 35% of almost 2,000 patients in intensive care units were non-white</a>.</p> \\n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"070e1ce7-43bd-462f-80b5-0be91d966238\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \\n  <div>\\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/XPF35H9RLNE?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\\n  </div>\\n </gu-atom> \\n</figure> \\n<h2>Nagpaul said BAME health professionals were understandably concerned about the deaths of their colleagues and what it might mean for them. The BMA chair said it might be too early to get firm answers but that it needed to be investigated.</h2> \\n<p>Among the factors he speculated could be contributing was whether BAME doctors felt less able to complain about inadequate personal protective equipment (PPE) – <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/06/nhs-doctors-lacking-ppe-bullied-into-treating-covid-19-patients\">a recurring complaint among healthcare workers during the crisis</a> – thereby putting themselves in danger.</p> \\n<p>“<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jun/02/black-nhs-staff-more-likely-bullied-than-white-colleagues\">BAME doctors often feel bullied and harassed at higher levels</a> compared to their white counterparts,” he said. “They are twice as likely not to raise concerns because of fears of recrimination.”</p> \\n<p>He said the death of BAME doctors was particularly upsetting because of “the vast majority – I think only one was born here – who have come from overseas and have given their lives to the NHS, to save the lives of others”.</p> \\n<p>Among the wider BAME population, he suggested the fact that many were in key worker roles, combined with their living arrangements, could be contributing to their disproportionate presence in intensive care units.</p> \\n<p>“You’ve got a high proportion of BAME people not able to stay at home, serving the nation, putting themselves at risk,” he said. “If you add that to overcrowded and multigenerational occupancies, the infections can be brought back home and spread to other members of the family.”</p> \\n<p>Nagpaul questioned whether enough was being done in terms of translating information leaflets about Covid-19 and physical distancing for people for whom English is a second language, suggesting mosques and temples could be used by the government to help relay the message.

How are they doing, and how is the lockdown affecting their puzzles?</p> <p>Looking at the first question first, you will be happy to hear that, on the whole, everyone seems largely well. As with the nation at large, we see the Great Time Availability Disparity. Some setters, with day jobs or volunteering cancelled, have far more time than usual to ponder crosswords. And many of the younger ones are having to schedule slots for setting where allowed by their new jobs as home-based teaching assistants.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/crosswords/crossword-blog/2013/jul/11/crossword-blog-meet-setter-otterden\">Maskarade</a>, for example, had a very busy 2019 doing double the usual amount of work in his other capacity as proof-reader for puzzle magazines in an effort to have six months’ worth of crosswords ready for Brexit (“where is that now, news-wise!?”, he adds) and now has “a lovely hiatus” offering puzzle time. Not so, though, for <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/crosswords/crossword-blog/2014/nov/03/crossword-blog-meet-the-setter-picaroon\">Picaroon</a>:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>With a seven-year-old to look after and educate full-time while simultaneously keeping up the day job from home, I’m definitely not one of those people who suddenly have more time on their hands – quite the opposite!</p> </blockquote> <p>What about the puzzles themselves? A big national event usually appears in puzzle form, if not in full-on themed crosswords, then via amusing references in clues. But it’s a long time since we wryly noted that coronavirus is <a href=\"https://discussion.theguardian.com/comment-permalink/138279283\">an anagram of carnivorous</a> (a fact that, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/crosswords/crossword-blog/2011/sep/22/crossword-blog-meet-the-setter-paul\">Paul</a> tells us, his vegan neighbour is keen on).</p> <p>At any rate, many papers avoid references to illness in their puzzles whether there’s a pandemic or not; for some it’s a “must not” and for others a “should not”, a mixture a little like government advice. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/crosswords/crossword-blog/2017/apr/10/crossword-blog-meet-the-setter-nutmeg\">Nutmeg</a> recently reworked a grid to remove an unfortunate “endemic” in a corner: an example of a word which can have a completely non-medical meaning but which nobody wants to come across when trying to relax with a crossword during a lockdown. As <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/crosswords/crossword-blog/2012/apr/26/meet-the-setter-puck\">Puck</a> says:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I was toying with a related theme just recently, but decided that solvers probably need cheering up rather than being reminded of the very thing that crossword solving might provide some relief from.</p> </blockquote> <p>On which subject, you’ll be pleased to hear that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/crosswords/crossword-blog/2011/dec/01/crossword-blog-meet-the-setter-tramp\">Tramp</a> is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/tvandradioblog/2012/jan/23/natalie-haynes-detectives-columbo\">getting into a Columbo box set</a> and keeping an eye on whether it offers up any themes. But, apart from the time factor, is setting more difficult?</p> <p>The answer seems to be that it’s not as easy – but still possible – to get into an playful frame of mind. Here’s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/crosswords/crossword-blog/2012/jan/05/crosswords-meet-the-setter-boatman\">Boatman</a> …</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>While I’m busy with the mechanics, I can forget about the situation for a while, and I can find my way into whatever part of my brain it is that creates the fun.</p> </blockquote> <p>… Puck …</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Creativity and, in my case, Puckishness are essential to the process in order to stay fresh and witty, and those are inevitably a little harder to come by at present.</p> </blockquote> <p>… and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/crosswords/crossword-blog/2012/aug/02/crossword-blog-meet-setter-pasquale\">Pasquale</a>:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I set to entertain, whatever people’s circumstances.</p> </blockquote> <p>So the supply keeps coming: trickier challenges for those who want a crossword to take up a chunk of their day and more straightforward puzzles for brand-new solvers (if you’re one, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/crosswords/crossword-blog/2020/mar/30/crossword-roundup-fancy-learning-cryptic-crosswords-during-coronavirus-lockdown\">we prepared a starter pack last month</a>).

This disproved the idea of herd immunity, which requires widespread infection, as a viable policy option, he said.</p> \\n<p>However, researchers, <a href=\"https://www.meinbezirk.at/c-politik/der-berg-ist-hoeher-als-gedacht-laut-stichproben-erhebung-bis-zu-67400-infiziert_a4028091\">speaking at a press conference</a> to release the results, said the study provided only a “snapshot” and did not account for asymptomatic infections, or people who were immune.</p> \\n<p>“We did not find out how many people are immune, but only how many people in Austria are currently acutely infected,” said Günther Ogris, from Sora.</p> \\n<p>The issue of the <a href=\"https://www.bmj.com/content/369/bmj.m1375\">proportion of asymptomatic infections</a> in the population remains highly contested, with a World Health Organization report in February suggesting truly asymptomatic cases were relatively rare. However, another small Chinese study, reported in the British Medical Journal earlier this month, posited that up to four-fifths of all infections could be without symptoms.</p> \\n<p>Ogris said Sora had “defined the population as all people living in Austria”, and added that the youngest test subject was not yet a year old, and the oldest was aged 94.</p> \\n<p>Commenting on the result, the science minister, Heinz Fassmann, said it indicated a low rate of immunity, which meant that without controls there was a continued risk of an exponential growth in infections.</p> \\n<p>“The mountain is higher than expected and we are not yet on the safe side,” he said.</p> \\n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \\n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/30/optimistic-nihilism-thomas-glavinics-ploy-for-getting-through-the-covid-19-crisis\">Paper prints Austrian author\\'s \\'coronavirus novel\\' in daily instalments</a> </p> \\n</aside> \\n<p>Austria’s current policy is to test people with symptoms, especially if they have been to a known hotspot or in close contact with an infected individual. That means many people, such as those with no symptoms, or no known contact to an at-risk area, go undetected.</p> \\n<p>The country reacted early to the outbreak, closing schools, restaurants, theatres and other gathering places more than three weeks ago, and telling people to stay home.</p> \\n<figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Callout callout-coronavirus\"> <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"<html><head></head><body><div data-callout-tagname=&quot;callout-coronavirus&quot;> <h2>Callout</h2> <p>callout-coronavirus</p> </div></body></html>\"></iframe> \\n</figure> \\n<p>Hospital admissions have stabilised, with the daily percentage increase in infections in low single digits. There have been 319 deaths and 13,337 confirmed cases, of which about 7,000 people are still infected. The study estimated the current number of infections was more than four times that, however, at around 28,500 people. It excluded those in hospital, currently about 1,000 people.</p> \\n<p>The study, conducted from 1-6 April, tested 1,554 people. It did not involve antibody tests, which can tell whether a person was previously infected and is therefore probably immune. Future studies should involve antibody tests, the government has said, to inform policy as the country starts to reopen shops from 14 April.</p> \\n<p>The education minister, Heinz Fassmann, whose portfolio includes research, said: “We must monitor whether there is a second wave and the number of infected people starts to rise again. We are still in a very, very sensitive situation. This study shows that, too. Corona is in our society.” </p>',\n",

But as UK deaths continue to mount – the official tally is now around 9,000, with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/09/covid-19-hundreds-of-uk-care-home-deaths-not-added-to-official-toll\" title=\"\">up to 1,000 people</a> who have died in care homes yet to be added – the tens of thousands who are mourning a close family member, and many others who have lost a friend, colleague or neighbour, are too occupied with private grief to demand a public accounting.</p> <p>Countless others are suffering the financial shocks caused by unemployment, with far worse to come. Meanwhile, the toll of the crisis on those with vulnerabilities including mental health difficulties and social isolation has barely begun to be measured. The nation, like many others, is in a state of shock – a mood of mingled fear and disbelief that was heightened by the events of the past week, during which the prime minister received treatment in the intensive care unit of St Thomas’ hospital.</p> <p>Boris Johnson remains ill in hospital. The Guardian wishes him a full and speedy recovery. His family, particularly his pregnant partner, Carrie Symonds, and his children, deserve every sympathy. His government, however, must continue to submit to forensic scrutiny. All the evidence suggests that its decision-making was poor, placing human lives such as Mr Chowdhury’s at increased risk (though it is not yet known whether the lack of PPE was a factor in his case). Of particular interest are the crucial four weeks between late February and the start of the lockdown on 23 March.</p> <p>One must always be cautious about apportioning blame with the benefit of hindsight. This is never more true than when confronting unprecedented events. But ministers’ decision to disregard the example set by east Asian countries in January, and the failure to prioritise testing and the sourcing of vital equipment (ventilators, masks), have cost lives. Suggestions that, as recently as a month ago, Mr Johnson was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/audio/2020/apr/10/coronavirus-100-days-that-changed-the-world-part-2-podcast\" title=\"\">worried about the impact of a lockdown</a> on his popularity, and feared that northern voters would object to pubs being shut, require closer examination. That the UK’s coronavirus strategy could have been influenced by such narrowly political calculations and stereotypes is horrifying.</p> <p>The lines between public and private life are being redrawn. The role of social media, the millions of people working and schooling from home, restrictions on travel: these factors and others mean that our society is being transformed. Support for the health service has probably never been stronger, as ministers knew when they created the slogan “Stay at home, protect the NHS, save lives”.</p> <p>The efforts of hospitals, care homes, social services and key workers including supermarket staff must continue to be clapped. But the spirit of national togetherness should not be invoked to fend off legitimate criticism. With deaths <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/09/uk-coronavirus-peak-at-least-two-weeks-away-chief-scientist-says\" title=\"\">expected to keep rising</a> for two more weeks, the bleakest sorrow awaits tens of thousands more families. Those lucky enough to escape the worst can still rage against the dying of lights such as Mr Chowdhury’s.</p>',\n",

Despite this, staff and students across the UK are launching initiatives to support both their local community and the NHS.</p> <p>Harrogate grammar school, a comprehensive in North Yorkshire, has repurposed its design department as a PPE production line, and has made more than 1,000 visors so far.</p> <p>Its headteacher, Neil Renton, said: “We’ve had parents who’ve been furloughed or lost jobs, who are ex-engineers, asking if they can help. We’ve not been able to support that as we’ve had so many staff members volunteer. I think it comes from an overwhelming desire from our teachers, who believe in public service, to make a difference.”</p> <p>The visors have been sent to local hospitals, paramedics and GP surgeries, as well as alumni working on the frontline.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"d434b6ad277578068da59bf884904f5f30adb9be\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d434b6ad277578068da59bf884904f5f30adb9be/0_257_739_922/401.jpg\" alt=\"Staff at Harrogate district hospital wear visors made at Harrogate grammar school\" width=\"401\" height=\"500\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Staff at Harrogate district hospital wear visors made at Harrogate grammar school</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Harrogate grammar school/Guardian Community</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Jack Sheriff, who left the school in 2014, is a junior doctor on a coronavirus ward in the Midlands, and received a pack of six visors last week, stamped with the school’s emblem, the NHS logo, and the message “we stand together”.</p> <p>He said: “It’s really nice to have contact with people from your past who helped you get to where you are, and who are still supporting you and thinking of you. It’s a bit of a blast from the past to be under that logo again, and nice to be using the visors made by the laser cutter I used at school.”</p> <p>Schools are used to providing support for their more vulnerable students but since the crisis, extraordinary efforts are being made to help communities.</p> <p>At Meadowfield primary school in Leeds, almost half the students are entitled to free school meals. As well as providing hot meals for families to collect each day, the school has sent out 145 food parcels containing enough supplies for two weeks, with the aim of sustaining vulnerable families over the Easter holidays.</p> <p>The headteacher, Helen Stout, said: “The butchers we use as a supplier have offered to give us bacon and sausages, and the local grocers have offered to do some delivery for us. People have been really kind and benevolent, and it’s nice to know we’re doing our bit.</p> <p>“It’s become a bit of a different role. It’s not just being head of a primary school, it’s managing community spirit.”</p> <p>Alongside staff-led directives to support pupils, students are embracing initiatives to celebrate and assist the key workers around them.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"ea34b9efac47b683b9e917c52348233434335630\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ea34b9efac47b683b9e917c52348233434335630/0_29_790_474/500.jpg\" alt=\"Staff at Meadowfield primary school in Leeds prepare to deliver supplies to families\" width=\"500\" height=\"300\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Staff at Meadowfield primary school in Leeds prepare to deliver supplies to families in their local community.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Meadowfield primary school/Guardian Community</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>At Thornhill College in Derry, many students expressed their fear and anxiety at the pandemic, many of whom had family and friends working on the frontline of the NHS. In response, the school asked for tributes to NHS staff to share on social media, and have been overwhelmed with the response. Along with the tributes, the school set up a fundraiser for their local hospital, with a target of £500 – a figure that has been trebled in just two days.</p> <p>“It really has taken on a life of its own,” said Orla Donnelly, the vice-principal. “We’ve been swamped with people paying tribute to NHS workers, saying what they’re doing and why they’re so proud. Past pupils, teachers, mums, grannies and aunts are all doing it too.</p> <p>“Our corridors are silent and classrooms are empty, it doesn’t feel right.

       "   'body': '<p>On the Andrew Marr Show last Sunday, speaking about Covid-19, Prof Neil Ferguson was described as being “more influential right now than any politician”. Ferguson <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/18/neil-ferguson-coronavirus-expert-who-is-working-on-despite-symptoms\">leads a team of modellers</a> at Imperial College London whose mission has been to predict the pattern and health impact of coronavirus transmission in the UK under different scenarios, and thereby help government make the right decisions about how best to protect the population.</p> \\n<p>The UK has some of the best infectious disease modellers in the world, and the government has been wise to draw upon their expertise. But all models have their limitations, and none can avoid the fact that decision-making must also be informed by people with relevant expertise and experience, and by the facts on the ground. In the case of Covid-19, where so much about the disease and its transmission dynamics is still unknown or unclear, models are useful – but experience and sound judgment are crucial.</p> \\n<p>This is becoming apparent across the world. Countries that lived through the experience of Sars and Mers appear to have been better prepared to deal with Covid-19 than those that didn’t. And in Canada, <a href=\"https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/bc-ontario-quebec-covid-19-1.5524056\">the success of British Columbia</a> in controlling Covid-19 compared with other provinces has been partly attributable to the combined ingredients of political experience and good judgment.</p> \\n<p>There is also a non-scientific element to decision-making which involves choosing between competing demands and needs in society, determining what is ethical and moral, and balancing challenges that are current and immediate with those that will only emerge in the future. For example, a model that incorporates value judgments is needed to balance the direct, visible and dramatic harms of Covid-19 with the more indirect, chronic and hidden social and economic harms of lockdown.</p> \\n<p>Furthermore, while it is often said that Covid-19 “does not discriminate”, this statement is only partially true. The virus disproportionately affects older people and men; and we can be sure that the effects of both the virus and the collateral damage of control measures will <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/apr/09/coronavirus-inequality-managers-zoom-cleaners-offices\">disproportionately affect the poorer and more marginalised</a> segments of society. How we manage this differentiated vulnerability is all about ethics and politics. It may be informed by a scientific model, but it shouldn’t be disguised as a technocratic problem that can be resolved by mathematical equations.</p> \\n<p>It is easy to be entranced by the cleverness of models that map, measure and predict the complex interactions of multiple natural and social variables. There is something impressive about the ability to produce answers in the form of precisely calculated numbers, and professionally crafted charts and graphs. And for politicians, nothing is more convenient than being able to say that they are merely following “<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/mar/25/uk-coronavirus-policy-scientific-dominic-cummings\">the science</a>” and evidence.</p> \\n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"ba9786c6-c779-4063-8bf9-1d3009eb7c70\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \\n  <div>\\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/3qV7R2iYVXg?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\\n  </div>\\n </gu-atom> \\n</figure> \\n<p>While Marr’s comment about Ferguson being the most influential person in the country was rhetorical, it hints at the perception that epidemiological modelling has played a disproportionately influential role in shaping the UK’s strategy and plans. Others have pointed out that some of the earlier modelling work had gaps that have adversely affected policy decisions. These include not accounting for the potential role of testing and contact tracing in mitigating the epidemic; not modelling the impact of sick patients on intensive care beds and other parts of the health system; and not modelling the epidemic across different regions of the UK.</p> \\n<p>It is not clear what caused these omissions. Perhaps they were the result of blindspots that persisted due to the lack of external scrutiny and challenge. In the case of the sidelining of testing and contact tracing, perhaps it was because the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage) had concluded that these measures were not worth while – a view that is understandable if Sage also saw the building up of herd immunity through natural infection as part of its strategy.</p> \\n<p>There has been lots of speculation as to why the UK delayed lockdown compared with other countries; why it was slow to increase viral testing capacity; and why the NHS was left so poorly prepared. Now is not the time to look backwards. Neither would I want to place any criticism on modellers. Rigorous modelling is done by clever modellers; but the design and testing of models, including the assumptions built into models and the questions that modellers have been asked to help answer, is a collective responsibility.</p> \\n<p>Modelling is vital and could assist greatly in going forward. In particular, two things should be urgently modelled. The first is to model the impact of different strategies that will help us avoid the harms of draconian, population-wide lockdown. This should include modelling the costs and benefits of weekly viral testing of the whole population (not 100,000 tests a day, but 10 million tests a day), or a more modest but greatly expanded testing regime, combined with aggressive case detection and contact tracing, coupled with continued physical distancing and improved hygiene. The former idea may sound radical and extreme, but is a serious proposal that could be implemented if there was sufficient political will.</p> \\n<p>Second, we must model (and then keep monitoring) the health and socioeconomic impacts of both the virus and the control measures, with short-, medium- and long-term timeframes, and with a social lens to look at how the virus has impacted differentially across society. For some reason, there was no modelling of the socioeconomic impact of lockdown. This was an omission – and as we enter the beginning of what could be a global economic recession, we could see thousands of lives cut short from this collateral damage.</p> \\n<p>Finally, from a policymaking perspective, there are two things needed. First, we need greater transparency and participation to allow effective scrutiny and challenge from scientists and public health specialists who are more independent of government. This will avoid the danger of groupthink and blindspots. Second, we must better acknowledge the limitations of evidence-based policy and recognise the importance of expertise, experience and sound judgment.</p> \\n<p>• David McCoy is a professor of Global Public Health and director of the Centre for Public Health at Queen Mary University of London.</p>',\n",

The beauty of blaming “China” lies in its ambiguity. Are critics merely condemning the way the Communist party concealed information during those crucial January weeks? Both <a href=\"https://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/entry/house-resolution-china-coronavirus-origin-trump-racism_n_5e7a2a80c5b6f5b7c54baf93?ri18n=true&amp;ncid=fcbklnkushpmg00000098&amp;guccounter=1\">liberals</a> and conservatives in the US, including <a href=\"https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1242202291718979587\">Donald Trump</a>, have used this defence.</p> <p>Or, is the clear subtext that the real culprits are the “Chinese people” and their <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/nation/2020/03/19/coronavirus-china-cornyn-blame/\">exotic culture and habits</a>? Leave it to Nigel Farage to clumsily play both sides, <a href=\"https://www.newsweek.com/nigel-farage-china-coronavirus-west-rethink-1493085\">claiming</a> both that he held “no ill-will against the Chinese people” but that the problem lay with “appalling hygiene conditions in Chinese wildlife markets” and the customary diet of bats and pangolins. Whatever the intentions, we now see how criticisms of “China” have translated into an upsurge of racist violence aimed at the Chinese and Asian diaspora living in the<a href=\"https://thehill.com/changing-america/respect/equality/490373-attacks-on-asian-americans-at-about-100-per-day-due-to\"> US</a>,<a href=\"https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/meghara/coronavirus-racism-europe-covid-19\"> western Europe</a> and<a href=\"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-8178421/Man-armed-WHIP-goes-racist-tirade-outside-Chinese-Consulate.html\"> Oceania</a>.</p> <p>I applaud the liberal condemnation of these attacks as <a href=\"https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2020-03-23/coronavirus-devastation-immigrants\">xenophobic</a>, but also worry that vague cries of tolerance for “Chinese people” and “culture” play into the racist framing of the right, in which we wind up debating identity and difference at the expense of dynamic historical processes. Any serious attempt to grapple with China’s role in this pandemic must also consider the specific political-economic conditions of China’s ascent within the global market in recent years, which facilitated the virus’s spread as well as planting the seeds for an Euro-American backlash.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>These dangerous sentiments will not disappear when a vaccine is created, unless we demand more than liberal appeals for tolerance</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Let’s take the claim that the novel coronavirus was caused by a culturally peculiar fondness for eating pangolins. Though it is true that pangolin scales and meat are advertised as a sort of folk medicine in mainland China, statistics suggest the real key variable are the effects of globalisation, which have enriched the country’s business classes. Prices for the animal have <a href=\"https://qz.com/874854/chinas-insatiable-thirst-for-pangolin-scales-is-fed-by-an-international-black-market/\">climbed from $14 </a>a kilo in 1994 to more than $600 today, while illegal shipments confiscated at the border regularly <a href=\"https://www.traffic.org/publications/reports/the-global-trafficking-of-pangolins/\">exceed 10 tonnes</a>. Customers ordering wildlife often do so in order to flaunt their wealth or to celebrate a good day on the stock market, although they remain a minority: <a href=\"https://www.researchgate.net/figure/Cognition-types-and-frequency-analysis-of-Chinese-urban-residents-attitude-toward_tbl1_225329213\">most Chinese citizens</a> support strict limits, if not a ban, on wildlife consumption. Resurgent pangolin consumption is thus a result of economic liberalisation in China – which the US championed – not simply of traditional culture.</p> <p>It was <a href=\"https://nplusonemag.com/online-only/online-only/chinese-virus-world-market/\">these same economic forces</a> that also hastened the spread of the virus overseas. Wuhan, where the virus originated, originally served as a hub between coastal metropolises, such as Guangzhou and Shanghai, and inland China. Although considered a “second-tier” city, even Wuhan has been caught up in the latest phase of globalisation, as capital pursues cheaper land and labour markets inland. During February and March cases of the novel coronavirus illuminated economic linkages long hidden from view, such as Chinese investments into infrastructure in<a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/irans-strategic-partnership-with-china-lies-at-root-of-its-coronavirus-outbreak-11583940683\"> Qom, Iran</a> or the ties between Wuhan’s car parts industry and factories in<a href=\"https://hbr.org/2020/02/how-coronavirus-could-impact-the-global-supply-chain-by-mid-march\"> Serbia, South Korea</a> and<a href=\"https://www.autonews.com/china/webasto-halts-travel-china-after-2-employees-germany-contract-coronavirus\"> Germany</a>. The coronavirus may have first appeared in China, but the ensuing spread and crisis also belong to the global assemblages of commerce, tourism, and supply chains erected by powerful interests in the 21st century.</p> <p>The great irony of blaming some vague notion of Chinese culture is that the best responses to the pandemic have come from the ethnic Chinese majority governments of <a href=\"https://www.thenation.com/article/world/taiwan-who-coronavirus-china/\">Taiwan</a> (five deaths, 380 cases), Singapore (six/1,910), and Hong Kong (four/974). Yes, their responsible policies were due largely to the trauma of the 2003 Sars epidemic but also have to do with the history of robust welfare states in <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/01/opinion/covid-face-mask-shortage.html\">East Asia</a>, which, unlike Europe and the US, have increasingly invested in healthcare infrastructure to deal with precisely such crises.</p> <p>To push back on the anti-China line is not to apologise or defend the state’s actions. It is clear that local officials were wrong to silence <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/20/chinese-inquiry-exonerates-coronavirus-whistleblower-doctor-li-wenliang\">Dr Li Wenliang</a>, who alerted friends about the virus as early as possible, and that the government has consistently downplayed the virus’s contagiousness and the severity of deaths.</p> <p>But is the contrast between authoritarian and democratic regimes so stark, as<a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2020/02/why-democracies-are-better-fighting-outbreaks/606976/\"> western ideologues</a> allege? Most observers agree that China covered up the crisis in Wuhan for three weeks in January, and this lost time probably decided the difference between a local versus a global epidemic. Nevertheless, it is still sobering to read reports that even from mid-January other governments took even longer to respond: the UK dragged its feet for<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/mar/18/coronavirus-uk-expert-advice-wrong\"> an interminable eight weeks</a> and the US<a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/us-intelligence-reports-from-january-and-february-warned-about-a-likely-pandemic/2020/03/20/299d8cda-6ad5-11ea-b5f1-a5a804158597_story.html\"> ignored clear warning signs for 70 days</a>.</p> <p>This inactivity was partly the product of a western exceptionalism that believed viruses and epidemics only happen “over there”, in poor and non-white countries. This is a crucial point for challenging anti-Asian racism. Rather than debate the blame game, as Justice is Global director Tobita Chow has written, we should point out how short-sighted <a href=\"https://fellowtravelersblog.com/2020/04/03/policy-from-the-people-cooperation-in-the-face-of-covid-19/\">nationalist perspectives</a> have produced fatally ineffective responses. During Italy’s worst weeks, officials<a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/21/world/europe/italy-coronavirus-center-lessons.html\"> admitted they</a> initially viewed the Wuhan crisis as a “science-fiction movie that had nothing to do with us”. In the US, a<a href=\"https://www.kansascity.com/opinion/editorials/article241353836.html\"> Kansas politician stated</a> that his town was safe because it had only a few Chinese residents. In Philadelphia, in a more tragic offshoot of racial thinking, <a href=\"https://www.citylab.com/equity/2020/03/coronavirus-immunity-racism-history-disease-yellow-fever/607891/\">rumours circulated</a> that the virus could not infect black Americans because it was a Chinese disease, misinformation that officials now fear <a href=\"https://www.inquirer.com/news/philadelphia-coronavirus-race-african-american-cases-rising-20200403.html\">exacerbated inequalities</a>.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/apr/08/coronavirus-black-people-ethnic-minority-deaths-pandemic-inequality-afua-hirsch\">If coronavirus doesn\\'t discriminate, how come black people are bearing the brunt? | Afua Hirsch</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Ultimately, both the pandemic and the accompanying anti-Asian backlash are dynamics that go beyond questions of culture and xenophobia, carrying serious life-and-death consequences. Both are the indirect byproducts of China’s emergence as a major force in global capitalism, not only forging the supply chains and travel networks that conveyed the virus but also threatening Euro-America’s centuries-long economic and political prestige.</p> <p>In the US, such fears were already manifest in populist claims that China alone – and not the domestic political and business class – was to blame for the loss of manufacturing jobs. In the wake of a referendum result seen as a vote against globalisation, anxieties in the UK have recently been manifest in <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-britain-usa-huawei-instantview/reaction-to-uk-allowing-huawei-a-role-in-5g-network-idUSKBN1ZR1FU\">panic over Huawei</a> providing the country’s 5G network. Fears over China were not created by coronavirus, but find in it a most apt metaphor, as a global and invisible force of destruction.</p> <p>It follows that these dangerous sentiments will not automatically disappear when a vaccine is created, unless we demand more than liberal appeals for tolerance. We need to also recognise and confront the political-economic forces behind the west’s anti-China backlash – and the inadequacy of nationalism in responding to the social and public health crises facing us today, which are global in scale.</p> <p>• Andrew Liu is an assistant professor of history at Villanova University and the author of <a href=\"https://yalebooks.yale.edu/book/9780300243734/tea-war\">Tea War: A History of Capitalism in China and India</a></p> <p><br><br></p>',\n",

Wales recorded 29 more hospital deaths, taking its total to 315, and there were 10 more deaths in Northern Ireland, bringing its total to 92.</p> <p>The figures in England showed a particularly sharp rise in fatalities in the Midlands, where the number of victims rose by more than 84% from 124 to 229 in 24 hours.

All but 56 of them had underlying health conditions.</p> <p>The latest data came after it was confirmed that coronavirus had claimed the life of a 10th NHS doctor.

We are truly devastated and will miss him dearly. He was a true foundation in our lives.”</p> <p>Asked how many healthcare workers had died during the crisis at the daily Downing Street press briefing, Hancock passed the question to chief nursing officer Ruth May who said that internal numbers were available for nurses, midwives, healthcare assistants and doctors but that it would be “inappropriate for me to go into numbering them” without family permission.</p> <p>Like Ayache, all the other nine doctors to have been named as victims of coronavirus have been from BAME backgrounds. They are:</p> <ul> <li><p>Abdul Mabud Chowdhury, a consultant urologist at Homerton hospital in Hackney, east London, who had pleaded with the prime minister for more PPE.</p></li> <li><p>Sami Shousha, a British-Egyptian doctor who specialised in histopathology, and had worked for more than 40 years at Charing Cross hospital in west London.</p></li> <li><p>Dr Edmond Adedeji, an A&amp;E doctor at the Great Western hospital in Swindon.</p></li> <li><p>Syed Haider, a British Pakistani retired GP, who had worked at the Valence medical centre in Dagenham, east London.</p></li> <li><p>Anton Sebastianpillai, a consultant geriatrician who trained in Sri Lanka and died in Kingston hospital, south-west London, just over two weeks after completing his last shift there.</p></li> <li><p>Dr Alfa Saadu, a retired medical director born in Nigeria, who had been volunteering at his local hospital in Welwyn, Hertfordshire.</p></li> <li><p>Amged el-Hawrani, an ear, nose and throat consultant of Sudanese descent who was working at Burton hospital near Derby.</p></li> <li><p>Adil El Tayar, a surgeon from Sudan, who died after volunteering in A&amp;E departments in the Midlands.</p></li> <li><p>Habib Zaidi, 76, a GP with Pakistani origins, who died after showing “textbook symptoms” of the virus.</p></li> </ul>',\n",

There have been missiles and bullets, loved ones killed, and the fear of being conscripted into the army or tortured in Bashar al-Assad’s prisons. But no matter how bad things got, there was always food.</p> \\n<p>“Now there is so much poverty,” the 25-year-old from the Damascus neighbourhood of Barzeh said. “There are families living on $200 [£160] a month, but I don’t call that living. It’s barely managing to eat. And now with the coronavirus some businessmen are capitalising on the panic and raising prices.” He asked that his real name not be used for fear of repercussions.</p> \\n<p>With Assad now <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jan/28/syrian-regime-captures-maarat-al-numan-in-idlib\">back in control of most of Syria</a>, the government should be focusing on the challenge of rebuilding a country it bombed into ruins while trying to drive out rebel forces and extremist groups. But since January the value of the Syrian pound – last year trading at 500 to the dollar – has dropped off a cliff, reaching a record low of 1,360 to the dollar on the black market in late March. As a result, inflation and the cost of basic goods are soaring. Even subsidised bread is sometimes unavailable as Damascus <a href=\"https://www.al-monitor.com/pulse/originals/2020/04/syria-regime-opposition-prices-wheat-crops-farmers-imports.html#ixzz6JCRm5IXx\">runs out of flour and wheat</a> reserves, relying on its Russian allies for emergency shipments.</p> \\n<p>According to a UN report from 2019, 83% of people across both government and rebel parts of the country were already living in poverty. The <a href=\"https://www.mei.edu/publications/people-cant-even-afford-buy-bulgur-discontent-rise-syrias-economic-crisis-worsens\">collapse of what is left of Syria’s economy</a> means the timing of the Covid-19 crisis could not be worse.</p> \\n<p>While the regime has imposed curfews and lockdown measures to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/23/syria-confirms-first-covid-19-coronavirus-case-amid-fears-of-catastrophic-spread\">slow the spread of the virus</a>, every day hundreds of people gather for hours to wait for bread at distribution points. In some cases, fights have broken out or people have stolen from food trucks in a desperate attempt to feed their families.</p> \\n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"12d9909c2d18934671b1ba3a3aad49a73f7d218e\"> \\n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/12d9909c2d18934671b1ba3a3aad49a73f7d218e/0_128_4216_2529/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Syrians wearing face masks in Damascus\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \\n <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Syrians wearing face masks in Damascus.

Government bread, which is supposed to cost 50 pounds a packet, now sells on the black market for up to 10 times as much.</p> \\n<p>The financial crisis <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/07/lebanon-to-default-on-debt-for-first-time-amid-financial-crisis\">next door in Lebanon</a>, long the main dollar market for Syrian importers, is the main trigger for Syria’s new economic instability, along with changes to how energy is imported from Iran and the drying up of foreign funding for the opposition, a lot of which used to percolate into government territory.</p> \\n<p>Assad may have all but won the war, but maintaining control in such a tense economic environment is a difficult new battle. Price increases for food, fuel and transport have even sparked rare protests against the government in places such as Sweida, a city in the south-west populated mostly by members of the Druze minority sect that has remained nominally loyal to the government throughout the war. Remarkably, no one was arrested: instead, the state news agency reported on the protests.</p> \\n<p>Damascus is seeking to exploit the Covid-19 emergency with renewed calls for the end of international sanctions, which it says will alleviate both the health and economic crises.</p> \\n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"interactives/2020/03/interactive-coronavirus-live/totals\" data-atom-type=\"interactive\"> \\n  <div>\\n   default\\n  </div>\\n </gu-atom> \\n</figure> \\n<p>While Syria’s broken healthcare system cannot cope with a major outbreak, relief from sanctions – which do not target the medical sector – is unlikely to reach Syrian civilians.</p> \\n<p>“Even if sanctions are lifted, the regime will remain broke. At a time of global competition for a limited supply of [protective equipment], ventilators and testing kits, when the USA is struggling to secure supplies, how will Syria be able to do so?” said Elizabeth Tsurkov, a fellow at the Foreign Policy Research Institute, a US thinktank.</p> \\n<p>“The regime has never prioritised the health of its citizenry or even its core support base over its ability to wage warfare. Healthcare in the Syrian army and militias is terrible.”</p> \\n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"749807fb65a053bc4b6276b6ec0f2386eea11e53\"> \\n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/749807fb65a053bc4b6276b6ec0f2386eea11e53/0_257_4040_2425/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Workers clean a street in Damascus\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \\n <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Workers clean a street in Damascus.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Xinhua/Rex/Shutterstock</span> \\n </figcaption> \\n</figure> \\n<p>People living in regime areas are already accustomed to buying or subsidising basic medical equipment such as needles, ventilators and medicine: according to the World Health Organization, since the war broke out only about half of Syria’s medical facilities are fully functional.</p> \\n<p>The situation in the rebel-held north-west, and Kurdish-controlled north-east, where thousands of people are living in displacement camps, is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/23/syria-confirms-first-covid-19-coronavirus-case-amid-fears-of-catastrophic-spread\">even more pressing</a>. Government-controlled Syria only has 19 confirmed cases of Covid-19 so far, but testing is almost non-existent, leading many to fear the reality is much worse.</p> \\n<p>“The situation with coronavirus is really blurry. No one knows what’s going on and people are scared,” Zukari said. “I don’t know what to believe. I think they are hiding it. Even after all the war we now have this.”</p>',\n",

       "   'body': '<p>The new shadow social care minister has called on the government to include fatalities from Covid-19 outside hospitals in its daily death toll, after the Guardian revealed that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/09/covid-19-hundreds-of-uk-care-home-deaths-not-added-to-official-toll\">hundreds of people had died from the virus in care homes</a> and not yet been counted.</p> <p>In a letter to the health secretary, Matt Hancock, Liz Kendall, who ran for the Labour leadership in 2015, said she had serious concerns that deaths of people in care homes were not being reported “in a timely manner”.</p> <p>The Guardian reported on Thursday that the industry body Care England estimated that the coronavirus death toll in care homes was likely to be close to 1,000, despite the only available <a href=\"https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/birthsdeathsandmarriages/deaths/bulletins/deathsregisteredweeklyinenglandandwalesprovisional/weekending27march2020\">official figure</a> being dramatically lower.</p> <p>Unlike hospital deaths, statistics for coronavirus fatalities in the community are only released weekly. The Office for National Statistics published figures for deaths in care homes for the first time on Tuesday, saying 20 people had died across the whole of England and Wales in the week to 27 March.</p> <p>That figure is 12 days behind the daily hospital death rate and relies on registered death certificates, which take an average of five days to process. With a time lag of around 17 days, social care operators say the scale of infection and fatalities is not being grasped.</p> <p>“This delay obscures the scale of the spread of Covid-19 in care homes and the impact on some of the most vulnerable people in our society,” wrote Kendall, who was appointed shadow minister for social care by the new Labour leader, Keir Starmer.</p> <p>“I therefore urge you to put in place a system where deaths relating to Covid-19 outside of hospital, including in care homes, are collected and reported regularly to the Department of Health and Social Care and published daily alongside deaths in hospitals.</p> <p>“For families and care staff, accurate and timely reporting of deaths of people in care homes is an essential step in tackling this problem and saving as many lives as possible. It will also enable the government to focus its efforts on ensuring all care staff get the PPE and testing they need.”</p> <p>Despite the low official figure, more than 120 residents of the UK’s largest charitable provider of care homes are thought to have died from the virus in the last three weeks, while another network of care homes is reported to have recorded 88 deaths.</p> <p>Care industry leaders and the Alzheimer’s Society told the Guardian that they believed the virus to be active in around half of care settings, which look after about 400,000 people in the UK. However, Prof Chris Whitty, the UK government’s chief medical officer, said on Tuesday that just over 9% of care homes had cases of Covid-19.</p>',\n",

       "   'body': '<p>For a week or so now, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/07/new-york-coronavirus-deaths-record-cases\">New York</a> has been at the centre of the coronavirus pandemic in the US, the<a href=\"https://news.sky.com/story/coronavirus-new-york-death-rate-highest-among-globally-comparable-regions-11969502\"> death rate in the city</a> headlined all over the world. For those of us who live here, the sense of worsening crisis – if we’re lucky – is measured in large internal fluctuations and small external ones.</p> <p>The <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/apr/03/comfort-ship-new-york-coronavirus-failure-symbol\">hospital ship</a> berthed 20 blocks south of my house is something I only see on the news. What has changed is more immediate. Things that even a week ago seemed necessary, including getting out every day for fresh air, now seem wanton. Our movements have become even more circumscribed. When we do go out, fully 90% of people on the street are in masks and our once-weekly trip to the store has changed. The panic buying phase is over, replaced by different fears. Yesterday, the supermarket was empty of people.</p> <p>At home, we lurch between wild optimism and gloom. It is a paradox of our present condition that, for many of us with young children, there is simultaneously no time and too much time. Whole days seem to pass in which I do nothing but stack and unstack the dishwasher, transitioning from work to home-school to dismantling the fort in the living room to collapsing into bed at 9pm. At the same time, not running a schedule has opened up a vast mental chasm, in which every assumption from before the outbreak is being tested. Why did we do it like that? And do we have to go back to doing it like that again?</p> <p>It’s hard to tell if any of these reckonings will last. I remember after my mum died, 15 years ago, thinking things will never be the same. In the first flush of grief, I was convinced I would value life more. None of the trivial stuff would matter. I would be kinder, braver, more grateful for sunlight on the garden – the whole nine yards.<br></p> <p>That lasted about three weeks. As the shock began to wear off, all I wanted was to return to my old life. I couldn’t remember what it felt like to see the world differently and I didn’t want to. There were no epiphanies: just the long, hard slog back to something approaching normality.</p> <p>For a lot of people, this period will entail real, personal grief as well as culture shock. But for those of us lucky enough to get through it without losing someone close, there will still be that period of grief-like readjustment, when for a second we will continue to see the world differently. It’s happening now, and somehow the more trivial the reckoning the more profound the sense of altered reality.<br></p> <p>Take laundry. Most New York apartment buildings have tiny communal laundry rooms where it’s impossible to enforce social distancing. So we’ve all stopped doing laundry, or at least stopped doing it every week. We’re not going out, so who cares. And why do we do it every week anyway? Getting the sodding laundry done was a huge weekly arse pain that has all but disappeared. We rewear clothes. We handwash in the sink. We don’t bother with the duvets. The sky hasn’t collapsed.<br></p> <p>The list of suspended obligations such as these is long and eye-opening: the abandonment of all non-hygiene-related personal grooming, particularly for women, points a big arrow to how time-consuming and expensive that bullshit was in the first place. The complete death of interest in celebrity comings and goings feels like cause for a national holiday. A lot of the things that seemed not only non-negotiable but desirable now don’t seem that way at all.</p> <p>The real luxuries are proving to be elsewhere. When the schools finally reopen I imagine that, in the first instance, having a working day without kids will seem unbelievably generous, even to 3pm when school ends. With this in mind, I can’t imagine going back to haemorrhaging a huge proportion of my income on after-school and summer camp programmes, just to win an extra three hours in my day. I’ll be more efficient. I’ll see more of my kids. If I make less, I’ll spend less. Everything will balance out.</p> <p>I have been here before. My instinct is these big resolutions won’t last. We’ll forget. The gravitational pull of business as usual will undo what felt like the most searing of insights. Finishing work mid-afternoon to run to pick up the kids will, after a few weeks, get harder, as the memory of working while being interrupted starts to fade. Perhaps another memory will remain; a more general sense of what it felt like to opt out of things we thought weren’t even optional; of asking ourselves if there were different ways to be.</p> <p>• Emma Brockes is a Guardian columnist</p>',\n",

       "   'body': '<p>Children’s TV and radio presenters are finding new ways to stop their audiences feeling stressed, following reports that young children are become increasingly anxious about the coronavirus pandemic.</p> <p>The BBC’s long-running Newsround programme has seen its audience rise substantially for its three daily broadcasts on the CBBC channel and <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/newsround\">its dedicated website</a>, with its reporters trying to find ways to provide optimistic takes on the news without sugarcoating the situation.</p> <p>“So many kids now have anxiety issues,” said Ricky Boleto, a presenter on the programme. “We’re letting kids know that we focus on what’s happening in their homes and gardens without making them feel they have to sort out the world’s problems … They’re sending questions such as ‘Is my grandmother going to die’? We’ve been trying to put them at ease.”</p> <p>He said children “have a very good moral compass, probably better than most adults” and Newsround aims to cover stories without patronising audiences: “The most important thing for us is to tell stories in a way that doesn’t presume knowledge, doesn’t patronise, and makes young people feel that this is their programme.”</p> <p>Plans to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2019/nov/16/bbc-plans-to-drop-afternoon-newsround-as-children-go-online\">cut the number of Newsround’s television broadcasts</a> and reallocate the budget on online content have also been put on hold due to the pandemic. Instead, the web team have focused on providing <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/newsround/51204456\">simple clear guides to the pandemic for children</a>. In the first week of the lockdown the Newsround website had 1.5 million unique visitors to its website, up 40%. It also offers the BBC a chance to prove its value to children and parents, especially as it faces a battle to retain the attention of kids once they reach the age of six or seven and they are tempted by YouTube and Netflix.</p> <p>The programme has seen an increased emphasis on asking children to submit their own material on how they are dealing with the lockdown while schools are closed: “There’s scary headlines elsewhere but Newsround is a safe space for kids to turn to while coronavirus changes everything about our lives. We try to be a positive platform as well and focus on what good is being done.”</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Callout callout-coronavirus\">  <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div data-callout-tagname=&quot;callout-coronavirus&quot;&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Callout&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;callout-coronavirus&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>Other changes are having to be made to children’s output. Amid the ongoing travel restrictions, the CBBC broom cupboard – the location where presenters introduce the next programme on the kids’ channel – has been transferred to presenters’ homes for the first time in 44 years. The BBC is also <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2020/apr/03/bbc-launches-daily-educational-shows-keep-children-studying\">preparing to launch an enormous range of educational programmes</a> from 20 April onwards.</p> <p>Matt Deegan, who runs the <a href=\"https://www.funkidslive.com/\">independent national children’s radio station Fun Kids</a>, said he has had to change the station’s output to reflect the new reality: “Our presenters refer to the fact that they’re broadcasting from home and talk about the positives and sometimes the negatives.”</p> <p>He has also launched a <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p087wy0l\">daily children’s podcast called Stuck at Home</a>, which has suggestions like using what’s in the recycling bin as as source for collages or creating Zoom quizzes for other family members. It has also become the first piece of content from a commercial radio station to be made available on BBC Sounds.</p> <p>Deegan said young children pick up on the severity of the situation: “I think there’s an awareness by them that parents think it’s serious and their sporadic anxiousness often gets eye rolls. The sheer volume of news drives parents to discuss things more openly than perhaps they normally would.”</p> <p>Boleto, the Newsround host, said explaining the news in simple terms for children was a real challenge: “Nick Robinson and Evan Davis have said that writing scripts for Newsround is harder than their day jobs. You have to go from the start, not presume any knowledge, and tell the story.”</p> <p>However, there is still space for some lightness on the show amid the pandemic gloom. He said: “We do still throw in the odd skateboarding dog and panda birth.”<br></p>',\n",

The Danes <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-52221259\">spoke of</a> “a financial crisis on steroids”. The European commission’s vice-president, Frans Timmermans, <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-52211650\">predicted</a> “the EU as we know it will not survive this”.</p> <p>Finally a last-minute package was agreed, for €500bn of emergency loan finance. This was little more than an extension of the existing European stability mechanism, designed to help individual countries in short-term emergencies. Even then, it was a mere third of what the European Central Bank had <a href=\"https://uk.reuters.com/article/uk-health-coronavirus-eurozone/ecb-urges-measures-worth-1-5-trillion-euros-this-year-to-tackle-virus-crisis-sources-idUKKBN21Q0U9\">said was needed</a>, €1.5tn euros. What was specifically not agreed was any sharing of the economic burden of the pandemic across European treasuries in general. It was mostly more loans.</p> <p>The reason was glaringly obvious, and as old as the EU itself. The northern European nations within the eurozone still do not trust the hard-pressed southern ones to spend money wisely and pay back their debts. It was the same reticence that governed the slow reaction to the 2008 financial crisis. In other words, the EU is not a true political union, like the United States or Russia or even the United Kingdom. When one EU country hits trouble, as Greece and Italy have done over Mediterranean migrants since 2015, the EU itself is silent. It turns its back and hopes trouble will go away.</p> <p>Political unions are specific things – a marriage of regions, provinces, states in one national unit – based on a sufficiency of shared identity and shared responsibility. When the US was created, it agreed to joint liability for federal bonds. When New Orleans <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/2010/aug/30/archive-katrina-batters-new-orleans-2005\">flooded in 2005</a>, Washington did not tell Louisiana it was on its own. Nor did Britain say that to Northern Ireland when the province collapsed into bloodshed in the 1970s. It has been pouring in money ever since.</p> <p>The Maastricht treaty of 1992 was based on an ambition to drive Europe towards just such a goal. That, and the subsequent Lisbon treaty of 2007, produced much bureaucratic infrastructure, ever wider “competences”, an executive presidency and an enhanced parliament – which, it was hoped, would convey consent to central authority. Crises like the present one are precisely what such a body should be able to handle.</p> <p>Yet as Britain showed at the time of Maastricht and since, Europe lacks that shared identity. It lacks accountable leadership to make consent effective. In 2008, Europe dragged itself behind emergency actions taken by Barack Obama in Washington and Gordon Brown in London. When the European Central Bank was galvanised into action, it did indeed “print money” through quantitative easing; but the easing was directly chiefly at underpinning German bank loans to Greece and others. It was banks that were rescued.</p> <p>This week it has been abundantly clear that many European governments simply do not trust the Italians and the Spanish to find a way out of the pandemic crisis responsibly. Italy is certainly in economic meltdown. Its system for getting cash into the pockets of poor Italians appears to have broken down. For the first time in 75 years, large numbers of Europeans are simply <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/29/italy-sets-aside-400m-for-food-vouchers-as-social-unrest-mounts\">unable to buy food</a>. Their erstwhile employers face bankruptcy, and their banks face collapse.</p> <p>Britain, outside the eurozone, can print money and hand it to employers – <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/apr/08/coronavirus-jobs-bailout-treasury-resolution-foundation-wage-subsidy-scheme\">apparently £40bn</a> if need be. That is classical monetarism, I assume to be tested to near destruction. It is sensible, and there is little likelihood of the cash dissipating into inflation. That option is not open to Italy. It has delegated it under treaty to the EU and its bank. It can only borrow, and Italy is already crippled with debt.</p> <p>Over the next fortnight, any hope of a truly concerted European response to coronavirus is implausible. The EU has so far been inert. Nation states have been forced back on their own science, and their own health resources. Borders have closed and suppressions varied, from total lockdown to none at all. An exasperated EU research council voted no confidence in its chief scientist, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/08/eu-most-senior-scientist-mauro-ferrari-resigns-handling-coronavirus-crisis\">Mauro Ferrari</a>, who resigned in a huff.</p> <p>It is clear that one country after another will soon be liberating its citizens from lockdown, even at some cost in extra deaths. As other Europeans see <a href=\"https://www.dw.com/en/coronavirus-what-are-the-lockdown-measures-across-europe/a-52905137\">Germans</a> and Scandinavians working, shopping and enjoying spring, the pressure on their governments to end the lockdown will be intense. Pressure will devolve on to health services, while wider economies will struggle to recover.</p> <p>The head of the International Monetary Fund <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-52236936\">says the world</a> is facing “the worst economic crisis since the Great Depression of the 1930s”. This surely is a time for the EU to show a capacity for leadership. It should use the opportunity to show its electorates, Europe-wide, that it can rise to the occasion and share responsibility across the board. Did not the founder of the EU, Jean Monnet, say that a new Europe “will be forged in crises”?</p> <p>Daily reports indicate that citizens across Europe are showing a collective concern and care for each other. The pandemic has revived a faith in local community, and in a shared sense of nationhood. Yet the reaction of key European governments to this financial emergency has been like that of the British people in 2016. They don’t trust the EU with their money. What you don’t trust with your money is not a union.</p> <p>• Simon Jenkins is a Guardian columnist<br></p>',\n",

They say that freedom is so important that losing it is worse than death (other people’s deaths, at any rate). Most of us don’t agree. We accept the need for social distancing. But even so, the lockdown rules don’t require us to stay in all the time. There are exceptions. Why not just one more, just for me, my family, our suntan cream and picnic basket? If my local park is empty, my family and I can enjoy our picnic <em> </em>in the open air. We refresh ourselves and don’t harm anyone else – they chose to stay at home anyway. What could possibly be wrong with that?</p> \\n<p>Moral and political philosophers have long struggled with the conflict between individual choice and the common good, between general rules and exceptions, and have come to very different conclusions about the right answer.</p> \\n<p>It is plainly rational, game theorists say, to make some people better off (me and my family) and no one worse off (everyone else). Some moral philosophers have thought it morally right too. According to utilitarians, rules are made to be broken, when you make people happier by breaking them.

In the time of coronavirus, that means staying away from other people.</p> \\n<p>But if you can do that while making yourself happier – by sunbathing or picnicking, because everyone else has obeyed the lockdown – it is not just permitted but actually morally right to go for it. Of course, seeing my family reclining outdoors may send onlookers into a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/apr/06/lockdown-viral-trends-5g-towers-coronavirus-cases\">righteous fury</a>, reducing the total happiness (though righteous fury can be pretty enjoyable too). Also we may inspire others to break the rules themselves, and if everyone thinks this way, the park will be full. That is dangerous for us all and it would be better to stay at home. But all this means is that I ought to be discreet. If I am, no harm, no wrong.</p> \\n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"3849e921-99ee-4b30-87d9-ad45ffd298fb\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \\n  <div>\\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/tVoHlEfXtJ0?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\\n  </div>\\n </gu-atom> \\n</figure> \\n<p>Can that really be true? <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/belief/2013/sep/20/west-kantian-ideal-freedom-society-suffers\">Immanuel Kant</a> thought the fundamental moral question was a different one: what if everyone did that? Kant thought it was right to act only in ways that could be a universal law. We know that if everyone picnicked in the park, no one could do so safely. When I do it anyway, I am acting in a way that could not be for everyone. I am relying on everyone else abiding by the rules, exploiting their conformity to benefit myself. I am treating myself as an exception, a special case. This is not a way of treating other people with respect. This is not fair.</p> \\n<p>If we accept that morality is not only a matter of harm and benefit, but also respect and fairness, we can see what is wrong with picnicking in the park at the present time. But once we start to think in these terms, we need to look at a much broader picture. As political philosophers such as Karl Marx emphasise, our individual decisions are made against a social background that we have not chosen. Lockdown is a very different experience for different people, depending on their personality, their family circumstances and their living conditions. It is easier to stay at home in a large, roomy house with a pleasant garden than in a cramped high-rise flat with no outdoor space.</p> \\n<p>Lockdown <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/apr/09/coronavirus-inequality-managers-zoom-cleaners-offices\">reinforces existing social inequalities</a>. It is even less excusable for the more fortunate to break the rules. Though we should all keep to the guidelines, it doesn’t follow that we should heap blame on those who don’t, not knowing what staying at home is like for them, not knowing their reasons for being out. Of course they should comply, but be kind; most people are doing their best.</p> \\n<p>It is a mark of the crisis we are in that simply sunbathing in the park raises the deepest questions about what truly matters in our lives: the happiness of all, even if I rely on others obeying the rules, as utilitarians would say. Or respect and fairness, as Kant would reply. The role of individual responsibility within a social context, as Marx would insist.</p> \\n<p>Finally, we can draw on another value very important to Marx (and Rousseau and Hegel too): the value of solidarity. There are huge disparities between the burdens a few are being asked to bear for the sake of the many. Doctors, nurses and other key workers constantly risk their lives to look after the sick and to keep essential services running. For the rest of us, there is very little that we can do to make a difference in this global crisis. It is easy to feel helpless and overwhelmed. But in fact, sitting at home, we can stand in solidarity with those who are doing more. We are doing our part, and treating fairly everyone else who is doing the same. It is the most, and the least, we can do.</p> \\n<p>• Alison Hills is a fellow and tutor in philosophy at St John’s College, University of Oxford</p> \\n<p><br><br></p>',\n",

       "   'body': '<p>When will the pandemic end? The future is uncertain, but it seems likely that over the next 18 months the UK will experience a cycle of national lockdowns while it awaits a vaccine. This is far from ideal. Repeated lockdowns could lead to mass unemployment, rising national debt, uncontrolled bankruptcies and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/01/singing-stops-italy-fear-social-unrest-mount-coronavirus-lockdown\">widespread social unrest</a> as people grow sick of draconian measures. Many people are now asking how quickly the lockdown can be lifted – and how soon we can return to normal.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/apr/09/brexit-britain-economy-coronavirus-gdp-figures-economic-growth\">Brexit had already damaged Britain\\'s economy. Now coronavirus could sink it | Gaby Hinsliff</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Monitoring the <a href=\"https://www.healthline.com/health/r-nought-reproduction-number\">reproductive rate of infection figure</a>, R<sub>0</sub>, will be crucial to any decision about lifting the lockdown. The figure indicates how contagious an infection is. As the R<sub>0</sub> number drops below one, each existing infection causes less than one new infection; eventually, the outbreak will decline and die out. When R<sub>0</sub> remains steadily less than one, governments may decide to gradually loosen restrictions, with the lockdown relaxed earlier in lower intensity areas and later in hotspot cities such as London.</p> <p>New data <a href=\"https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(20)30746-7/fulltext\">published this week</a> in the Lancet, from a team of researchers at the University of Hong Kong led by the clinician Gabriel Leung, shows that the spread of infection in China outside Wuhan, measured by the R<sub>0</sub> in four major cities (Beijing, Shanghai, Shenzhen and Wenzhou) fell below one within two weeks of partial lockdown. This is good news; it shows a partial lockdown can quite quickly suppress transmission of the virus. Our national lockdown and social distancing measures may already have brought the R<sub>0</sub> down across much of the country.</p> <p>But the problem still remains of how to prevent a second surge. The Hong Kong researchers worry that as economic activity restarts, local and imported cases of coronavirus could lead to new outbreaks. And the R<sub>0</sub> rate varies across different regions: case fatality rates were just below 1% in Beijing, Shanghai, Shenzhen and Wenzhou compared with 5.9% in Wuhan. We will likely also see a higher rate of infection and death rate in London than the rest of the UK.</p> <p>Moreover there’s a crucial difference between the response to coronavirus in China and that in the UK. From the beginning of the outbreak, the Lancet researchers note, “only residents were allowed to enter residential communities, face mask-wearing was made compulsory, and non-essential community services were shut down”. Health authorities also <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/09/the-new-normal-chinas-excessive-coronavirus-public-monitoring-could-be-here-to-stay\">found cases</a>, traced contacts and isolated them, monitoring their quarantine closely.</p> <p>So it was not just a lockdown and social distancing that were responsible for bringing down the R<sub>0</sub> number in China, but the country’s community surveillance approach. Scarred by memories of the Sars outbreak in 2002, China and other east Asian states acted with greater speed, imposing total or partial lockdowns supported by a protective shield of community measures – finding people with the virus, isolating them swiftly, and tracing those they contacted.</p> <p>In South Korea, this took the form of mass testing and digital contact tracing; in Taiwan, Hong Kong and Vietnam, health authorities identified cases based on people’s symptoms, and used testing when available. Strict isolation of cases and contacts was monitored by phone apps and home visits. Rather than enforcing a one-size-fits-all approach, China varied the lockdown across different regions. While Wuhan was under <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/19/chinas-coronavirus-lockdown-strategy-brutal-but-effective\">total lockdown</a>, other provinces had more autonomy, and focused on quarantining the household clusters where most transmission took place.</p> <p>Data seems to show that this approach is the right one. Death rates in Asian countries have been lower than in the US and Europe (South Korea’s death rate, for example, is four per million and stable; the UK’s is 105 per million – and rising). In addition to helping reduce the R<sub>0</sub> number, a community shield may also allow governments to lift national lockdowns more quickly. Rather than maintaining a prolonged lockdown, governments can target measures at people who actually have coronavirus. This would likely be far less disruptive to the economy: better to quarantine 10% of people who have coronavirus symptoms than an entire population.</p> <p>At first, Britain eschewed the community shield approach. On 12 March the government stopped community testing and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/12/uk-moves-to-delay-phase-of-coronavirus-plan\">moved to a “delay” phase</a>, explaining that a managed spread of the virus across 60% of the population, with a case fatality rate around 1%, would hopefully produce <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/mar/15/epidemiologist-britain-herd-immunity-coronavirus-covid-19\">herd immunity</a> and allow the economy to move on. After its modellers realised this strategy would overwhelm the NHS, the government enforced a lockdown. It is now attempting to conduct 10,000 tests a day, mostly in hospitals for patients and health workers.</p> <p>Despite Britain’s slow start, there are reasons for hope. Behind the scenes, general practices and public health workers are working at tremendous speed to build our own protective shield. They’re finding places to treat infected patients who aren’t sick enough for hospital but can’t be nursed at home, visiting those with long-term conditions or coronavirus symptoms, and building a picture of community spread using 111 data. The UK should also be able to roll out contact tracing using the new <a href=\"https://www.digitalhealth.net/2020/03/nhsx-coronavirus-contact-tracking-app/\">NHSX app</a> and the popular <a href=\"https://covid.joinzoe.com/\">Zoe Covid symptom tracker</a>.</p> <p>We have four to six weeks to ramp up testing and build our community shield before we lift the lockdown. After this, we can then get most people back to work, focus on quarantining individual cases and contacts, and suppress outbreaks if they arise. Hopefully this approach will help us avoid further national lockdowns. But it will take a long time before life returns to normal.</p> <p>• Anthony Costello is professor of global health and sustainable development at University College London</p> <p><br></p>',\n",

Several major issues remain open and need to be hammered down, notably the rescue fund’s sourcing.”</p> <p>The entire package included agreement on boosting the lending capacity of the European Investment Bank and a new €100bn scheme proposed by the European commission to keep funding employee salaries if they are put on reduced hours. All of the measures will need to be signed off by 27 heads of state and government.</p> <p>Charles Michel, the former prime minister of Belgium, who is now president of the European council, the EU decision-making body comprised of heads of member states, said he would hold an e-summit with leaders on 23 April.</p> <p>He said: “The agreement of the Eurogroup is a significant breakthrough. More than half a trillion euros are now available to shield European Union countries, workers and businesses. With this unparalleled package, we shoulder the burden of the crisis together. This compromise is aimed at quick targeted relief... It is time to lay the ground for a robust economic recovery.”</p>',\n",

       "   'body': '<p>My debut album, Geography, was a jolly, summery record, but when I made it I was going through a breakup, I was by myself a lot, it was summer and I was locked in the studio. It wasn’t very fun. But I’ve always managed to make feelgood music regardless of whether I’m feeling good – perhaps that’s set me in good stead for where we are now.</p> <p>I have been trying to achieve something every day, even if that is just a big cycle ride. I’ve been doing cover versions or jamming on the guitar, and putting them on YouTube. And I want to get into film scoring – I now have so much time, it’s something I want to work on as a craft. Maybe it’s because everything seems so dramatic right now that film scores sound so good.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c56t7upa8Bk\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/c56t7upa8Bk?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>So I’ve been listening to Hans Zimmer’s Inception soundtrack.

And <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2020/feb/15/tame-impala-the-slow-rush-review-kevin-parker\">Tame Impala</a> dropped his new album recently, which I like, but I went back to his early stuff – Apocalypse Dreams on Lonerism is so feelgood and dreamy. He is a studio legend – his live drums sound like samples – and I’m always trying to work out how he does his stuff. I get to the point where I don’t even realise how much I’m nerding out. I’ll mention something to my girlfriend about a track and she’ll be like: what <em>are</em> you on about?

       "   'body': '<p>Before we went into lockdown, I was trying to persuade my mother to reduce her contact circle to five. It seems absurd, now that everyone of advanced age and comorbidities has been told to see no one at all, but way back then (three weeks ago), this seemed reasonable. She immediately bartered the number up to six. It was like negotiating with Tony Soprano: there was no way she was coming out of the deal without the upper hand. Then I asked her how she planned to tell the rest of her associates that they weren’t on the list, and she said: “Good heavens, I’m not going to <em>tell </em>them. That would be so rude!”</p> <p>Then the list was reduced to zero, but mysteriously, one of the original six went round anyway to fix her letterbox. I asked what was the point of fixing her letterbox, when the only important letter she was going to get <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/shortcuts/2020/mar/16/coronavirus-skype-lessons-and-exercise-plans-how-older-people-are-preparing-for-lockdown\">would be from the government, telling her not to have anyone round</a>, irrespective of whether or not she had a defective letterbox. She said she would prefer to have less advice, and be given a lethal injection. “I wouldn’t mind,” she said, graciously. “I”m not sure whether the main impediment to euthanasia is whether or not you mind,” I observed, extremely calmly and not at all sarcastically.</p> <p>My friend’s mum got a guy round to fix her cutlery drawer, which has been broken for two years. My sister’s neighbour, supposedly in full cocoon, still goes to the shop every day and, when she said she would go for him, he said: “I’m just in and out. It’s not like I’m asking anyone to dance.” Another cocoon-candidate in my life goes out before dawn every morning just to smell the sea, like the bloody French Lieutenant’s Woman. My uncle spent the night before the pubs closed in a Wetherspoon’s, which I disapprove of in 17 different ways. It is very annoying trying to get the people who should take this the most seriously to take it seriously at all. But it’s also sort of a duff judgment to make, because when you have a life-limiting condition, and even before this happened, you already felt like – in my mother’s words – a hot-air balloon with a terminal puncture, waiting to hit the ground, it is highly debatable and a completely personal matter whether you want to spend <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/22/which-conditions-mean-that-you-should-isolate-for-12-weeks\">12 of what is a finite number of weeks completely on your own</a>.</p> <p>Not everyone over 70 is in the same situation. For some, that “underlying health condition” means they wouldn’t even be admitted to hospital, nor want to be. It simply isn’t possible to adjudicate across the piece, from a distance, as if the elderly were one homogeneous mass.</p> <p>Yet we are all trying to build new rules, at speed, and the easiest way to do so is to constantly, volubly judge each other. Since the sun came out, it has been like a new season of censoriousness. In any normal year, the spaghetti straps would appear and society’s sap would start to rise. This year, it’s a super-charged indignation. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2020/mar/23/is-it-ok-to-shout-at-strangers-who-arent-social-distancing-absolutely\">Families are furious with joggers, cyclists are furious with bipeds</a>, everyone hates dog walkers, except anyone with a dog, who is wondering why dogless people have to be out at all. The usual great sunbather debate – regular human beings getting vitamin D, or spawn of Satan? (somebody get <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b006qk11/episodes/player\">The Moral Maze</a> on the case) – was less interesting to me than my own bugbear, people with huge gardens and/ or no clue what it’s like to live with a two-year-old and a four-year-old, waxing judgmental about why everyone couldn’t do the responsible thing and remain totally indoors, open a window if they felt so stir crazy. But I got my own comeuppance with that, when I launched full tilt into a fight on Twitter with one of the “just stay indoors” brigade, only to find that she was quarantined away from her own children, and had been for weeks, because she worked in a hospital. So yes, I was categorically the arsehole.</p> <p>All bets are off, and there are no shortcuts: you cannot possibly guess why that person is behaving the way they are, or saying the things they do. You can’t know what pressures they are under, or whether it was the same or better or worse yesterday. You can’t know what they think about their own mortality, or why. You can’t even know for sure what bubbling tensions are driving your own reactions, until you wake up at 5am, dreaming about Harriet Harman trying to save a sinking island through the medium of dance, and realise it’s possible you are more anxious than you thought. There is really no alternative but to put our own finger-pointing on ice, or under lockdown, if you prefer.</p> <p>My mother, incidentally, was right and there appears to be an unlimited number of people who wish they were on her list-of-zero. Someone left a bottle of rosé on her doorstep the other day, and she was worrying that she didn’t know who to thank. I said: “Put a giant sign on your door, saying, ‘Thanks for the rosé.’ That way, the person will feel thanked, and the whole street will know that you appreciate rosé.” I might be insensitive but I am also a stone cold genius.</p> <p>• Zoe Williams is a Guardian columnist</p> <p><br></p>',\n",

The government would also gain the ability to restrict freedom of movement and assembly, seize private property and enforce quarantines.</p> <p>In addition, a catch-all clause would authorise “other measures that are deemed appropriate and necessary in response to the state of emergency”.</p> <p>Hun Sen initially downplayed the threat of coronavirus, and at one point threatened to throw journalists out of press conferences if they wore masks. When the Westerdam cruise ship was turned away by several other countries concerned about the outbreak, Hun Sen not only allowed the ship to dock but attracted international attention by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/feb/16/woman-let-off-cruise-ship-in-cambodia-tests-positive-for-coronavirus\">hugging passengers as they disembarked</a>.</p> <p>The country, where a lack of media freedom means scrutiny is limited, has since recorded 115 cases of the virus. Schools and entertainment venues have been shut, and wider travel restrictions announced.</p> <p>The state of emergency could be invoked whenever the country is considered to be facing a great risk, such as in a pandemic, war or disruption to public order, according to the law.</p> <p>Anyone found guilty of disobeying emergency measures, which are vaguely worded and could be used to target government critics, faces 10 years in prison.</p> <p>David Griffiths, director of the office of the secretary-general at Amnesty International, described the legislation as indefensible. </p> <p>“This is a blatant exploitation of public panic around Covid-19 and threatens to eviscerate the human rights protections which are guaranteed by the Cambodian constitution and international human rights law,” he said.</p> <p>Independent journalists, government critics and people speaking about Covid-19 online are being arrested on a daily basis, he added. </p> <p>This week, Sovann Rithy, a journalist working for broadcaster TVFB, was arrested for quoting a recent speech by Hun Sen in which the prime minister said: “If motorbike-taxi drivers go bankrupt, sell your motorbikes for spending money. The government does not have the ability to help.” The police arrested Rithy, stating that Hun Sen’s words were intended as a joke.</p> <p>Griffiths said: “The idea of concentrating even more unchecked power into the hands of this government is worrying in the extreme.”</p> <p>Asean Parliamentarians for Human Rights (APHR), an association of members of parliament from south-east Asian countries, said similar laws are being used across the region to crack down on critics. </p> <p>This includes the Philippines, where individuals can be jailed for spreading false information about Covid-19, and Thailand, where an emergency decree allows the prime minister to censor publications for a broad range of reasons. Officials in Thailand also have additional powers to arrest and hold people without charge if they are suspected of having a role in causing an emergency.</p> <p>Thailand’s prime minister, Prayut Chan-o-cha, and Hun Sen, “have both shown in the past already creative ways to hang on to power”, said Teddy Baguilat, a former Philippines MP and board member of APHR. “We need to make sure that the Covid-19 pandemic does not become their new tool to further legitimise and secure their authoritarian leadership.”</p>',\n",

Let’s fund the NHS instead | Letters</a> </p> \\n</aside> \\n<p>He said: “We’ve had to create a whole new logistics network, essentially from scratch.” Within a week, every NHS hospital would be receiving daily deliveries, he added.</p> \\n<p>The shadow health secretary, Jon Ashworth, welcomed the promise that more PPE would reach the frontline but pressed Hancock to ensure his target was met.</p> \\n<p>Ashworth said: “This isn’t the first time ministers have given NHS and social care staff big promises on PPE. But there has been a mismatch between statements at Downing Street press conferences and the realities facing health and care staff on the ground.</p> \\n<p>“<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2020/mar/22/nhs-staff-cannon-fodder-lack-of-coronavirus-protection\">Staff have been raising the lack of PPE for weeks</a>. We hope the government’s plans today deliver the adequate supplies of PPE our brave healthcare staff deserve.”</p> \\n<p>Doctors’ and nurses’ leaders criticised Hancock’s plan as inadequate, given the growing death toll of NHS staff from coronavirus. <br></p> \\n<figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Callout callout-coronavirus\"> <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"<html><head></head><body><div data-callout-tagname=&quot;callout-coronavirus&quot;> <h2>Callout</h2> <p>callout-coronavirus</p> </div></body></html>\"></iframe> \\n</figure> \\n<p>The British Medical Association said PPE shortages could spell “real disaster” for doctors. It also took issue with Hancock’s insistence that the NHS has enough PPE to go round but needs frontline staff to use “no more and no less” than they clinically require.</p> \\n<p>Dr Chaand Nagpaul, the BMA’s chair, said: “We are dealing with an unknown, highly infectious, and potentially deadly virus that has already claimed the lives of several healthcare workers, including 11 doctors in the UK.</p> \\n<p>“It is absurd that the people trained to treat this disease are the ones who are not being appropriately protected – and without them, we face real disaster.</p> \\n<p>“We note the government’s announcement this afternoon … However, PPE should not be a ‘precious resource’ and for NHS staff facing shortages of protection they need today, they don’t want to hear of a plan, but that this vital equipment is made available to the frontline now.”</p> \\n<p>Susan Masters, director of nursing at the Royal College of Nursing, also voiced scepticism that Hancock’s pledges would end the supply problems that are causing alarm among staff, and denied nurses were misusing PPE. <br><br>Masters said: “These figures on deliveries are only impressive when nursing staff stop contacting me to say what they need to use wasn’t available. The calls are still coming through – people are petrified. They have seen colleagues die already.<br><br>“Things have improved in recent days and I credit the government with that. But the safety of nurses and care staff must not be compromised. They are pretty clear about what they need to do to stay safe and they will be angered by any suggestion they cause shortages by misusing kit.”</p> \\n<p>As well as promising to tackle what he acknowledged was the “enormous challenge” of ensuring PPE reaches those who need it, Hancock said lab capacity had been increased sufficiently to allow any health or social care worker who needs it, to be tested.</p> \\n<p>He visited a newly opened “mega-lab” in Milton Keynes on Thursday and said 15 drive-through testing centres were available.</p> \\n<p>He stressed the complexities of meeting demand for PPE against the background of rocketing global demand, and without a significant domestic supply sector.</p> \\n<p>Diplomatic staff around the world have been pressed into service trying to source equipment, Hancock said, with Whitehall officials in London trying to organise transporting it to the UK.</p> \\n<p>He praised firms, including Burberry and Rolls-Royce, which have turned their facilities to manufacturing PPE – and urged others to do so, based on requirements published by the government. “If you’ve got production facilities, and you can meet our published specifications, we want to hear from you,” he said.</p> \\n<p>Appearing alongside Hancock, May underlined the toll, both physical and mental, that treating the virus is having on her frontline colleagues. But she said they were heartened by the public’s support. “The rainbows and NHS signs in the windows lift me, and they lift my colleagues,” she said.</p> \\n<p>She and Hancock emphasised the importance of the public continuing to use the NHS for conditions unrelated to the coronavirus.</p> \\n<p><br></p>',\n",

English Heritage’s offering alone has gone from having a small dedicated following to almost 2m views since mid-March.</p> <p>“People are craving something different to watch I think,” said Hipperson. “They want to take their mind off the situation and try something new. I would definitely encourage people to try the recipes.”</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/mar/26/food-wholesalers-seek-help-over-unwanted-coronavirus-stockpile\">Food wholesalers seek help over unwanted produce</a> </p> </aside>  <p>English Heritage is not alone in seeing a surge in interest in online cookery demonstrations.</p> <p>Nearly 5.5 million people have this week watched Oprah Winfrey on her Instagram page <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/tv/B-nJfpgB8sb/?hl=en\">make spaghetti carbonara</a> “for the first time” after she watched Jamie Oliver on YouTube.</p> <p>On Thursday, Winfrey, in California, and Oliver, in Essex, teamed up for an Instagram live stream to make his Singapore-style fried rice together, a recipe made from using up scraps of veg and any bacon, sausage or frozen prawns you can find.</p> <p>Many chefs, stuck in their real kitchen rather than their work one, are also taking to Instagram. Sarit Packer and Itamar Srulovich, the founders of Honey &amp; Co, have started their #honeyandcoathome series from their south London home offering a flourless chocolate cake for Passover and <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/B-uk6IMDzPF/\">hot cross non-denominational buns</a>.</p> <p>Massimo Bottura, the Italian multiple-Michelin award winning chef, is livestreaming his family dinner prep every night. His <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/tv/B-kL9ZtIAoF/?hl=en\">toasted almond and saba ice cream with a pistachio sauce </a>is not exactly cupboard leftovers but still had more than 200,000 views.</p> <p>Food historian and writer <a href=\"https://angelaclutton.com/\">Angela Clutton</a> will on Saturday at 1pm be cooking lamb chops and veg from her kitchen as part of a daily <a href=\"https://www.timeout.com/london/news/borough-market-is-posting-live-cookery-lessons-on-instagram-032520\">Instagram live series created by Borough Market in London</a>.</p> <p>“There is a lot going on and people have been just so fast in putting these things together,” she said. “It’s because food is always such a great connector, it brings people together and somehow it is still managing to do that even when we can’t actually be together. I have to say I find it incredibly reassuring.”</p> <p>Crocombe was the real cook at <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2017/jul/19/ghost-stories-british-authors-imaginations-sarah-perry-mark-haddon\">Audley End House in Essex</a> between 1880 and 1884, serving Lord and Lady Braybrooke and their guests. Hipperson has been playing her for more than a decade, part of a team of interpreters putting on live demonstrations in the kitchens as well as the YouTube videos which have now taken off in such a big way.</p> <p>Hipperson said Crocombe had become a phenomenon in the same way people love Downton Abbey. “She was a real person, working in the kitchen, and people can relate to her … she’s not a monarch.</p> <p>“I make her as I imagine she would be, quite stern but clearly loving her work. She is quite joyful to watch I think. The fact that we are cooking real historical recipes is a factor too.”</p> <p>The recipes include hearty soups and ice cream made from staple ingredients. Others are a bit more of a performance.</p> <p>For example, <em>turbot à l’anglaise</em> sees Crocombe advising us to get a scullery maid to wash and pat dry the fish. She then rubs it with half a lemon, puts it in a turbot kettle and adds water.</p> <p>Once that’s on the heat, prepare a sauce with some butter, diced lobster and pounded roe and get a kitchen maid to push it through a sieve.</p> <p>Hipperson admitted US audiences “really did not like” the Victorian macaroni cheese recipe which is made from pasta, cheese, breadcrumbs and butter. “You couldn’t get much further away from mac and cheese.”</p> <p>Others are much more straightforward, said Hipperson, such as the <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lRI9LHBOpk0\">queen drop biscuits</a>, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XKPTUxoBw88\">cheese seftons</a> and, this weekend for Easter, saffron buns. “Some of them are trickier, like the apple dumplings, but they are just divine.”</p> <p>Avis Crocombe is one part of a much bigger <a href=\"https://www.english-heritage.org.uk/history-at-home/\">History at Home hub launched this week </a>by English Heritage, an online resource of videos, podcasts, articles and activity sheets.</p> <p>All its properties are closed but Matt Thompson, head collections curator, hopes the hub will provide distraction and comfort during the lockdown. “For me, it is a 21st-century cabinet of curiosities,” he said.</p> <p>“It is all in one place and we are planning new content.

Combine the flour, sugar, salt, egg and yeast together with enough milk to make a soft, but not sticky dough. Knead for 15-20 minutes and set aside in a warm place, covered with oiled plastic wrap or in a bowl with a cloth over until it has doubled in size (roughly 2-3 hours).</p> <p>Once the dough has risen, remove it and flatten it out slightly. Soak the saffron in the warm milk to get most of the colour out. You can then add add your other ingredients. Put the spices, lemon zest, lard, butter, saffron in its milk (which should now be yellow) and currants in the middle, fold it up, and knead again, folding and squeezing so that the new ingredients are well-incorporated (NB: these days you can also just put everything in a food mixer armed with a dough hook!). Cover again, and leave to double in size once more.</p> <p>Lightly grease two baking sheets and shape your dough into 12 equal buns. Round them off and leave in a covered bowl for 20 minutes to double in size once again.</p> <p>Whilst waiting, create a glaze with an egg, a pinch of salt, and 1 tbsp of milk. When ready, brush over each bun. Then, bake in the oven at 180c/350F for 15-20 minutes until each bun is golden brown. Serve on their own, or slathered with butter.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dzhQO46suYw\">A YouTube video of Mrs Crocombe making the saffron buns is available.</a></p> <p>• This article was amended on 13 April 2020 because an earlier version omitted a reference to when to add the butter in the method for the saffron buns recipe. It was further amended on 15 April to note that there is a video demonstration of the recipe available.</p>',\n",

       "   'body': '<p>Britain’s coronavirus lockdown is facing its biggest test yet amid rising temperatures at the start of the Easter bank holiday weekend as police mobilised to stop getaways to second homes and a government “Stay Home Save Lives” message was targeted at younger men in particular.</p> <p>A multi-pronged policing response included stopping caravans and those suspected of going to second homes, patrols of urban parks and rural beauty spots, as well as Ministry of Defence police boats engaging with people on beaches through loudspeakers.</p> <p>Celebrities including the England rugby head coach, Eddie Jones, the TV presenter Emma Willis and the former boxer <a href=\"https://twitter.com/mrdavidhaye/status/1248606824120516609?s=20\">David Haye</a> have been deployed as part of a government-sponsored social media campaign.</p> <p>Men aged 18 to 35, who are among the most likely to be in breach of social distancing guidelines, are understood to be a particular focus of the campaign, which also targets the broader population.</p> <p>As well as warning that people face being fined £60 on the spot by the police if they fail to follow social distancing from strangers, the appeal strongly focuses on saving lives by reducing the impact on the NHS.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"f1858c700bdad7327aa7c79cf275d7133a08be6d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f1858c700bdad7327aa7c79cf275d7133a08be6d/0_117_3500_2101/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Police officers talk to members of the public at a park in Northampton\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Police officers talk to members of the public at a park in Northampton.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Joe Giddens/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>There was an early indication that an Easter getaway might not materialise as images released by the location technology firm TomTom showed a dramatic fall in traffic levels for London, Manchester and Birmingham on Thursday compared with the equivalent day last year.</p> <p>But concerns about the coming days were heightened by new data, based on people who consented to having their movements tracked by Google, showing that visits to parks increased last weekend compared with two weeks ago.</p> <p>Chief nursing officer Ruth May spoke at Friday’s Covid 19 Downing Street briefing of her “enormous frustration” at how some people were clearly not respecting social distancing or coming out in large numbers and said she had seen a “horde” of cyclists crossing Westminster Bridge as she made her way to the event.<br><br>She added: “The reason it’s also frustrating is that there are still occasions where my colleagues are getting abuse from their neighbours for driving off to work.”</p> <p>It came amid warnings that some police forces could move to an “enforcement phase” from a current approach of just issuing advice to people breaking rules, and the first minister of Wales said restrictions could get worse if people flout social distancing rules.</p> <p>Dr Paul Cosford, medical director for Public Health England, called for people to stay at home over Easter because social distancing measures are working.</p> <p>“People are complying [with the measures] in a very large majority and the impact that is having is that transmission is much, much less than it would otherwise be,” he told ITV’s Good Morning Britain.</p> <p>A picture was meanwhile emerging of differing police responses, sometimes guided by their demographics and relationships with local communities.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"2ce8367a02fb65b9468749d7ec7dcbb955117f85\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2ce8367a02fb65b9468749d7ec7dcbb955117f85/261_454_5624_3376/1000..jpg\" alt=\"Police on horseback patrol Regent\\'s Park in London\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Police on horseback patrol Regent’s Park in London.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: James Veysey/Rex/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In London, where the Metropolitan police is understood to be taking a less hands-on approach, in contrast to forces in other parts of the country, action nevertheless included the closure by local authorities of a pitch and putt course in Queen’s Park due to people sunbathing and gathering in groups of more than two.</p> <p>In Wales, where police had said that some visitors were travelling along B-roads at night to evade them - officers <a href=\"https://twitter.com/nwpruralcrime/status/1248310587219738626?s=12\">were investigating reports</a> that second homeowners have been sending ahead their luggage using courier services so that if they were stopped in their car on the way they could plead innocence.</p> <p>Police were stopping drivers on their way south through Conway on Friday to check they were not holidaymakers heading for the Llyn Peninsula, Anglesey or any other popular tourist destination.</p> <p>Some English incomers still managed to get through. S4C Welsh television featured <a href=\"https://www.dailypost.co.uk/news/north-wales-news/moment-couple-staying-snowdonia-airbnb-18069561\">a stand-off between an angry local resident </a>and a couple staying at an Airbnb property in Snowdonia. “How dare you come to this village and dare spread this, there’s a lot of old people here and sick people. How stupid are you?” shouted the local resident at the couple, who had travelled 182 miles from Oxford in the south of England to Penmachno, near Betws-y-Coed in Conwy.</p> <p>At lunchtime on Friday, Lancashire road police reported a “noticeable increase” in traffic. “Please ask yourself if your journey is essential. We’ve engaged and educated a number of you today but the message remains @stayhomesavelives” the force tweeted. They <a href=\"https://twitter.com/LancsRoadPolice/status/1248580672404500480?s=20\">also reported </a>stopping a driver who had travelled more than 20 miles to Lytham, near Blackpool, “to buy Easter eggs”.</p> <p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/CumbriaRoadsPol/status/1248575012241539072?s=20\">Cumbria roads police</a> said it had also only used “words of advice” by midday on Friday, tweeting “the fells and lakes will be here when this is over”.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Callout callout-coronavirus\">  <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div data-callout-tagname=&quot;callout-coronavirus&quot;&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Callout&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;callout-coronavirus&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>In North Yorkshire, police in Scarborough tweeted <a href=\"https://twitter.com/NYorksPolice/status/1248578401167949824?s=20\">photos of a deserted seafront</a> as well as the near-deserted A64 to Malton. In Merseyside, local officers reported New Brighton promenade was also empty.</p> <p>But social media also underlined the problems of policing. Cambridgeshire police deleted a tweet saying they were patrolling around supermarkets, insisting it was not monitoring what people were buying, while South Yorkshire police apologised <a href=\"https://twitter.com/grandad1975/status/1248247686563631104?s=20\">after a video</a> circulating on social media appeared to show an officer reprimanding a man for using his own front lawn.</p> <p>• <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2020/mar/27/coronavirus-and-volunteering-how-can-i-help-in-the-uk\">Coronavirus and volunteering: how can I help in the UK?</a></p> <p>• This article was amended on 10 April 2020.

From next week, deliveries will only reach families every other month, instead of monthly.</p> \\n<p>Some donors, including the US, have already cut funding to UN programmes in Yemen because of concerns aid has been diverted by Houthi authorities.

His <a href=\"https://robertjenrick.com/about-robert/\">website</a> says he lives with his family near Newark, his constituency in Nottingham, and London.</p> <p>The revelations also prompted a former Tory minister to accuse Jenrick of “arrogance”. But Jenrick defended his actions, saying he went to deliver food and medicine to his isolating parents. However, the Guardian understands his parents – who are aged 69 and 79 – were already receiving help from the local community, raising questions over the necessity of his trip.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-atom\"> <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"65a9450f-4bec-4555-bdb0-c829a2782b42\"         data-atom-type=\"guide\"    > </gu-atom> </figure>   <p>Asked whether he thought Jenrick was ignoring the government’s stay-at-home advice, Nick Thomas-Symonds, the shadow home secretary, told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme: “I think that’s for him to explain. As you know, the delivery of essential supplies like food and medicine to vulnerable people, vulnerable family members, would be permissible in the exceptions that there are for people to go outside.</p> <p>“But I think it’s very important now for public confidence that Robert Jenrick fully explains himself and why exactly that journey was necessary.”</p> <p>Downing Street defended Jenrick with a spokesman insisting the minister had complied with social distancing guidelines.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/09/why-even-cabinet-ministers-must-stay-home-in-lockdown\">Government instructions</a> say: “You should not be visiting family members who do not live in your home.” The only exception is if they need help, such as having shopping or medication dropped off.</p> <p>The former Tory minister Anna Soubry, who left the party in opposition to its stance on Brexit, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Anna_Soubry/status/1248509452426391558?s=20\">tweeted</a> on Friday morning: “The selfish arrogance of 2 trips #RobertJenrick telling cramped families in inner city high rises or squeezed suburban homes to #StayAtHome is bad enough but justifying it by asserting he didn’t break the rules is shameful. Snr Ministers must practise what they preach.”</p> <p>She added: “#RobertJenrick didn’t break #COVID-19 rules but he totally ignored his own instruction to #StayHome which he repeatedly said in media interviews &amp; from the No 10 podium. It smacks of arrogance. For some time many of us have said Govt messaging must be clear, consistent &amp; honest.”</p> <p>Steve Reed, Labour’s new communities spokesman, earlier <a href=\"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-8206255/Cabinet-minister-Robert-Jenrick-seen-visiting-parents-lockdown.html\">told the Daily Mail</a>: “MPs need to set an example to everyone about the importance of not moving around the country and if Robert Jenrick can’t provide a very good explanation as to why these trips were necessary then he needs to consider his position.”</p> <p>The row over Jenrick’s movements broke out after Scotland’s chief medical officer last week quit her post following intense criticism after she twice visited her second home. And it came amid ongoing questions over the whereabouts of Dominic Cummings, whose location Downing Street has repeatedly refused to clarify when asked this week.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Callout callout-coronavirus\">  <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div data-callout-tagname=&quot;callout-coronavirus&quot;&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Callout&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;callout-coronavirus&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>After the Guardian’s story on Jenrick was published, the minister <a href=\"https://twitter.com/RobertJenrick/status/1248341191738998787?s=20\">tweeted</a>: “For clarity – my parents asked me to deliver some essentials – including medicines. They are both self-isolating due to age and my father’s medical condition and I respected social distancing rules.”</p> <p>Defending moving to his Herefordshire property, he told the Mail that his family considered it the family home. </p> <p>Nearly three weeks ago the government published guidance warning people against all but essential travel, highlighting this “does not include visits to second homes” and that “people must remain in their primary residence”.</p> <p>Jenrick’s actions were defended by others, with Prof Paul Cosford, the emeritus medical director of Public Health England (PHE), suggesting it sounded like Jenrick had remained within the four “clear” guidelines by travelling 40 miles to deliver medicine and other essential items.</p> <p>“I can’t comment on Mr Jenrick. It sounds as if what he did was within one of the four guidelines to me, but others will obviously have to think about that more,” he said.</p> <p>Speaking at the daily No 10 lobby briefing, the prime minister’s spokesman said: “The secretary of state has set out in two different statements the reasons for the journeys that he made.</p> <p>“We are confident that he complied with the social distancing rules.”</p>',\n",

       "   'body': '<p>Since the coronavirus gripped Europe there has been one main theme to the emails pouring into the Guardian’s Consumer Champions column: why is my airline refusing to give me a refund?</p> <p>The rules are quite clear: if a flight is cancelled, the airline has to offer you a refund. The <a href=\"https://www.caa.co.uk/Passengers/Resolving-travel-problems/Delays-cancellations/Your-rights/Your-rights-when-you-fly/\">Civil Aviation Authority</a> states explicitly that “If your flight has been cancelled, your airline must offer you the choice of a refund or alternative flight.”</p> <p>But the airlines are trampling all over consumer law and the CAA appears to have abdicated responsibility for enforcing the rules.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2020/apr/08/reschedule-flights-get-refund-airlines-easyjet-coronavirus\">Why can\\'t we reschedule our flights or get a refund?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>As we <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2020/apr/08/reschedule-flights-get-refund-airlines-easyjet-coronavirus\">reported earlier in the week</a>, easyJet has removed its refund option from its website, obliging those who don’t want to reschedule to join the lengthy queue for the helpline.</p> <p>British Airways is no better. Its <a href=\"https://www.britishairways.com/en-gb/information/incident/coronavirus/latest-information?dr=&amp;dt=British%20Airways%20%7C%20Book%20Flights,%20Holidays,%20City%20Breaks%20%26%20Check%20In%20Online&amp;scheme=&amp;audience=travel&amp;CUSTSEG=&amp;GGLMember=&amp;ban=%7C%7CP1M%7C%7C%7C%7C%7C%7C%7CHOME%7C%7C%7C%7CL4%7C%7C%7C%7Canonymous-inspiration%7C%7C%7C&amp;KMtag=c&amp;KMver=1.0&amp;clickpage=HOME\">website</a> simply says: “If your flight has been cancelled you can rebook or claim a voucher online”, without any mention of your right to a refund.</p> <p>My brother has spent many hours fruitlessly trying to call the airline after it cancelled his £800 flight. There’s no way to email the airline, or even an address for post. It’s a matter of take the voucher – or wait endlessly in a call queue.</p> <p>Meanwhile, Ryanair bluntly says it cannot process refunds until the pandemic has subsided, and the best that passengers can hope for, right now, is a voucher valid for 12 months.</p> <p>Cue fury all round? Yes, people are right to be utterly frustrated at this behaviour and the denial of their rights.</p> <p>Yet I have a smidgen of sympathy for the airlines. They are on the peg for huge lease costs on now-grounded planes and are still paying a large chunk of staff costs. They are heading for losses of $252bn (£202bn) should the lockdown last three months, says the International Air Transport Association (Iata). Realistically, how are they going to cash-flow billions of pounds in refunds? It’s not a surprise they are sticking their fingers in their ears and not picking up the phones.</p> <p>Is there a halfway house, a solution that might satisfy the majority of people yet not permanently erode consumer rights?</p> <p>The big problem with vouchers is the restrictions around their use. BA, Ryanair and easyJet say they are valid for 12 months only. Why? What if you don’t plan another journey on a route served by that airline in the next year?</p> <p>Irish airline Aer Lingus has got it mostly right. Firstly, it has offered travellers a <a href=\"https://www.aerlingus.com/support/forms/voucher-refund-request-form/\">10% bonus</a> if they apply for a voucher; if you paid £100 for your flight, you’ll get a voucher worth £110.</p> <p>Secondly, it lasts five years, not one. Aer Lingus is part of the same company, IAG, as British Airways, so it’s a mystery why BA is not making the same offer.</p> <p>Thirdly, vouchers need to be fully transferable to other individuals without penalty. So if my brother were to accept a voucher for his cancelled £800 flight, he’d get a £880 voucher that I or someone else will happily pay him £800 for. It’s win-win-win. My brother gets his money back, I get a discount ticket, and the airline does not have to cash-flow a refund.</p> <p>I was asked to volunteer to come off an overbooked £250 BA flight from London to Bangkok in 1997. It offered me a £400 voucher, an overnight hotel at Heathrow and a definite seat the next day. The voucher had no expiry, and six years later I used it during a BA sale to buy two return tickets to New York. It was a total bargain. Vouchers really can work.</p> <p>The banks and credit card companies have offered coronavirus victims payment holidays. In a sense, opting for vouchers is giving a payment holiday to an airline while the business is in an almost impossible financial position.</p> <p>But if we do let the airlines go down this route, it should be time limited, and the usual rules reinstated when normal life resumes.</p> <p>It’s certainly better than a taxpayer-funded bailout, which is what the airlines will demand if their cash runs out.</p> <p>But I write this working from home in an attic room. One of the few joys from the ghastly virus is to look up to a sky brilliantly free from vapour trails. Maybe once the issue of refunds is sorted, the question that will be ever more pressing is whether we should be flying so much anyway.</p>',\n",

Its earliest findings suggest younger children (aged four to 10) are more worried than those in the 11-16 age group. </p> <p>The results are based on the responses of 1,500 parents who have so far signed up to the Co-SPACE (Covid-19 Supporting Parents, Adolescents and Children in Epidemics) <a href=\"https://oxfordxpsy.az1.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_3VO130LTKOcloMd\">survey</a> and indicate that more than half of younger children (53%) are worried about family and friends catching the disease.</p> <p>A third of parents (33%) who took part in the survey said their child was worried they would catch Covid-19 themselves, nearly a quarter (23%) of the youngest children were frightened of infecting someone else and more than a third (36%) were anxious about missing school work.</p> <p>Almost a fifth (17%) of parents said their younger children were afraid to leave the house and 19% said their children were worried the family would not have enough food and other essential items during the outbreak, after news coverage of panic buying and empty supermarket shelves.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2020/apr/10/the-cheapest-greenest-holiday-ever-the-weird-joy-of-garden-camping-with-the-kids\">The cheapest, greenest holiday ever: the weird joy of garden camping with the kids</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Parents of children in the younger age bracket also said their children were worried about the amount of money coming into the household (16%), and about the long-term impact of the disease outbreak on the future (15%).</p> <p>According to parents’ perceptions, their older children are significantly less worried, though researchers point out it can be hard for parents to know what their adolescent children are feeling, in contrast with younger children who may express their fears more openly to their parents.</p> <p>Less than 2% of 11- to 16-year-olds are worried about the long-term impact of the crisis on their job prospects and the economy, according to their parents; 5% are worried about money coming in; 8% are afraid to leave the house, and one in 10 (11%) are worried about not enough food.</p> <p>Older children are worried about their families, with two out of five (41%) frightened that friends and relatives will catch the disease; just over a fifth (22%) are worried they will catch Covid-19 themselves and one in 10 (11%) are anxious they could pass the infection to someone else.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"b9417d188461cc0a374df65da61c34ef836fa811\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b9417d188461cc0a374df65da61c34ef836fa811/0_0_3859_2563/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Benches on Clapham Common, which would usually be heaving with families this Easter weekend, have been put out of bounds by Lambeth council.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"664\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Benches on Clapham Common, which would usually be heaving with families this Easter weekend, have been put out of bounds by Lambeth council.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Gill Allen/REX/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Cathy Creswell, professor of developmental clinical psychology at Oxford and one of the study leads, said: “Clearly [children] are aware there’s a threat in the environment. Everyone recognises it’s a serious issue.</p> <p>“But one of the things we can see here is that the majority of children are not worrying excessively about it, but seem to be taking it in their stride. There are, however, a significant sub-group who are reporting high levels of worry.”</p> <p>The results indicate that anxiety levels are much greater among parents than their children. Nearly a third of parents (32%) say they are afraid to leave the house, almost two in five (37%) are worried about not having enough food and three in five (64%) are worried about the long-term impact on jobs and the economy.</p> <p>They are also more likely to be worried about friends and family catching the disease (88%), about getting the disease themselves (61%), and about transmitting the infection to someone else (64%).</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"42ebf6aeacd3d7333888fccc92d12850676c3cbf\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/42ebf6aeacd3d7333888fccc92d12850676c3cbf/0_0_5431_3621/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Families where grandparents normally played a key role but no longer could because of the lockdown had been severely affected.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Families where grandparents normally played a key role but no longer could because of the lockdown had been severely affected.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Cat Simpson/Alamy Stock Photo</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>“Research has provided valuable information about how parents and carers can support their children’s mental health in general,” said Creswell. “However, at this point, we know very little about what might be most effective in the current context of Covid-19. We hope to have more than 10,000 parents and carers across the UK complete the new online survey. Their responses will help us really understand how families are coping and what support could make all the difference to children, young people and their families at this time.”</p> <p>Wendy Minhinnett, who leads a support group for parents of young people who struggle with mental health difficulties, said many parents were struggling. “People are feeling really, really isolated and alone. When you are supporting a child with mental health issues, that puts extra pressure on you.”</p> <p>She said families where grandparents normally played a key role but no longer could because of the lockdown had been severely affected, as had families with children diagnosed with autism whose routines had been entirely disrupted.</p> <p>“One parent said, ‘My son will not let me go anywhere because he is so frightened of me catching something’. People are really, really anxious about it.”</p>',\n",

You wonder what’s behind the government’s refusal to give a straight answer along the lines of “many weeks more”. An aversion to spoilers? Maybe it welcomes the distraction. On Thursday, Dominic Raab intoned that this crisis had “made us think long and hard about who the key workers are in our lives”. Not that hard, as it turned out. Also on Thursday, the government sneaked out its <a href=\"https://twitter.com/pmdfoster/status/1248253551689773057\">points-based immigration planning</a>, which ranks many of the same “essential workers” somewhere between convicted foreign sex killers and people who tick yes to the visa inquiry “Have you ever been involved in preparing an act of terrorism?”. Or to put it the way the official Home Office guidance prefers: “There will not be an immigration route specifically for those who do not meet the skills or salary threshold for the skilled worker route.” Forgive me if even mentioning the people getting us through it constitutes some kind of crisis faux pas. For some, ignoring the realities low-paid nurses or delivery workers face is key to the spirit of national togetherness.</p> <p>One of the unwritten conventions of British public life is that no matter how ill-advised or ill-prepared any military action we’ve committed to is, once it starts, you get behind the troops. The government keeps telling us this current crisis is a war, so in the spirit of speaking their preferred language, I guess the troops are us. Not them: they’re the generals. So let me be clear that I’m very much getting behind us, and thank us for our service.</p> <p>But when we’re seeing 1,000 casualties a day - just as we did in Italy while our generals were still deciding not to act – and grave problems with testing, and NHS staff are crying out daily for the right kit, it’s certainly worth considering whether the troops were led into an ambush. The people dying right now are likely to have caught the disease in the middle of last month (between 11 and 21 March), when the government’s advisers reportedly surmised the <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-coronavirus-britain-path-speci/special-report-johnson-listened-to-his-scientists-about-coronavirus-but-they-were-slow-to-sound-the-alarm-idUSKBN21P1VF\">British people would never accept a lockdown</a>. It’s – how to put this blandly enough not to offend the free-speech snowflakes out there? – OK to wonder if we might have expected better.</p> <p>Instead, though, there’s a sort of meth-assisted Boys’ Own quality to some of the more obsessive lines of inquiry. This week, there was some focus on whether Dominic Raab had written the so-called “letters of last resort”, replacing the versions of them Boris Johnson wrote when he took office, which contain instructions for who takes military charge in the event of the nuclear obliteration of the government. It’s an interesting question, isn’t it? A thousand people are dying every day and some members of the lobby would very much like to know if Mr Raab has written to a submarine captain.</p> <p>Then again, given the seismic collapse in ad revenues, it looks like all of us journalists are going to need to retrain into different careers after this, so it’s probably good to showcase alternative skill sets.

       "   'body': '<p>Scottish fishermen are turning to food banks and welfare organisations, as the coronavirus crisis has led to plummeting demand for seafood, leaving many unable to work to feed their families.</p> <p>Worst-hit are lobster and crab fishermen in Scotland’s south-east and west coasts, according to the Fishermen’s Mission, a Christian welfare charity. Staff at the charity have also identified “pockets of need” in Shetland and as far south as Newlyn in Cornwall. This comes just before the Easter holiday, traditionally a period of increased demand.</p> <p>Claire McIntosh, the Mission’s area official for south-east Scotland, has been working 12-hour days fielding calls from crews whose skippers have had to tie up their boats.</p> <p>“I’ve been liaising with food banks since January,” said McIntosh, whose patch covers the 80 miles of coastline from Seahouses in Northumberland to Port Seton in East Lothian. “This is on the back of poor weather and poor catches during winter. They are very self-sufficient folk, very resilient, resourceful and hard-working. Their last resort is to come to us. But I’ve handed out £17,500 in the last few weeks, compared to £12,000 for the whole of the last year.”</p> <p>The UK fishing industry is worth £989m annually, with Scottish vessels responsible for more than half, at £574m in 2018. More than 70% of its catch is exported, mainly to Europe and Asia, but foreign and hospitality markets have collapsed in the crisis. While a much smaller retail market still exists for some fish, many supermarkets have shut their fish counters, reducing demand further. For high-value shellfish, the market is now virtually nonexistent.</p> <p>“Langoustine, shrimp and prawn are almost impossible to get rid of and the demand for crab and lobster in China has just vaporised,” said David Dickens, the Mission’s chief executive. “When there’s a pandemic, people aren’t interested in high quality seafood.”</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/apr/01/one-seafarer-almost-cried-the-last-chaplain-visiting-quarantined-boats\">‘One seafarer almost cried’: the last chaplain visiting quarantined boats</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The charity’s 71 staff across the UK are expecting things to get worse.</p> <p>“All the indications are we’re at the beginning of a curve of need,” said Dickens. “This is the calm before the storm. From Kirkcudbright in the south up as far as Mallaig, there’s a lot of very worried people. We’re planning for the worst, but hoping for the best. Our focus is keeping the lights on and keeping food on the table.”</p> <p>On 25 March, the Scottish government announced a £5m assistance package aimed at 650 seafood companies impacted by the collapse in the market for shellfish, and for owners of full-time registered vessels under 12 metres.</p> <p>Dickens welcomes <a href=\"https://www.gov.scot/news/support-for-seafood-fishing-industry/\">the scheme,</a> which is underway, but said he and his staff are supporting crew or skippers who are ineligible, including those working part time.</p> <p>A further £10m package for fish processing businesses was announced by the Scottish government on 3 April. A spokesperson said: “Work on the grant to processors is ongoing and we hope to open applications soon.”</p> <p>They added that further support is being made available, including a £2.2bn grant to help Scottish businesses pay staff and treat them fairly.</p> <p>Donna Fordyce, the interim head of trade marketing body Seafood Scotland, which is working on exploring other alternatives to get Scotland’s seafood to consumers, said: “It’s a pretty grim picture across the board. The seafood sector has been one of the hardest hit of all the sectors in Scotland, because of the level of exports. The market has more or less collapsed in Europe.”</p> <p>It was already a bad year for fishermen, she said, with the “worst weather we’ve seen for 15 years for fleets”, before the Covid-19 crisis hit.</p> <p>“The prawn and the scallop fleet are more or less all tied up,” said Fordyce. “The whitefish fleet, some are still going out.</p> <p>“It is going to be a UK market for the next few months.”</p> <p>Scotland has <a href=\"https://www.gov.scot/news/scottish-sea-fisheries-statistics-2018/\">2,089 registered vessels and 4,860 crew</a>. </p> <p>Among those waiting to find out if they are eligible for the £10m fund for processors is Jamie McMillan, the managing director of Loch Fyne Langoustines and Loch Fyne Seafarms. McMillan, who employs 22 staff directly and a further 48 on vessels, was forced to close temporarily three weeks ago because of the pandemic.</p> <p>“We are waiting with bated breath,” said McMillan, who processes and exports scallops, lobsters and crabs. “If we can’t get that or we are not eligible, we’re finished.”</p> <p>McMillan is currently paying his staff 80% of their salary, under the coronavirus retention scheme, which he can claim back from the government. But he lost 44% of sales to Hong Kong and China when Covid-19 first hit there, and has been losing money since January.</p> <p>“We are having to pay staff weekly. It’s a huge strain on the business as we haven’t any cash.”</p> <p>Based in Tarbert, Argyll and Bute, which has a population of 1,500, McMillan is one of the village’s largest employers.</p> <p>“Twenty-two jobs is a lot of families,” McMillan said.</p> <p>“The whole fishing industry is going to look different when we come out of this. Our customers in Hong Kong are saying 50% of their restaurants have not survived.”</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Callout callout-coronavirus\">  <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div data-callout-tagname=&quot;callout-coronavirus&quot;&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Callout&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;callout-coronavirus&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>Selling direct to the public, a tactic used by some shellfish fishermen in Devon and Cornwall, is more challenging in remote communities in Scotland, he said.</p> <p>“Everyone is trying to sell to the general public but for us it’s very precarious.

Johnson was “enormously grateful for the care he’s receiving,” the official added, saying “he was waving his thanks towards the nurses and doctors that he saw as he was being moved from the intensive care unit back to the ward”.</p> \\n<p>A No 10 spokesman added later on Friday: “The prime minister has been able to do short walks, between periods of rest, as part of the care he is receiving to aid his recovery.</p> \\n<p>“He has spoken to his doctors and thanks the whole clinical team for the incredible care he has received. His thoughts are with those affected by this terrible disease.”</p> \\n<p>Matt Hancock, the health secretary, told the daily briefing that Johnson’s condition continued to improve. “He wants to personally thank the whole clinical team at St Thomas’ for the incredible care he has received,” Hancock said.</p> \\n<p>The updates came after the prime minister’s father, Stanley, spoke of the improvement in his son’s condition, saying he was “amazingly thankful” for the efforts of the NHS and appreciative of the nation’s outpouring of support.</p> \\n<p>But he insisted his son – <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global/2020/apr/09/boris-johnson-moved-from-intensive-care-but-stays-in-hospital\">who is still being treated</a> at St Thomas’ hospital in London – must rest, warning that he cannot get “straight back to Downing Street and pick up the reins”.</p> \\n<p>He added: “To use that American expression, he almost took one for the team.

Asked what contact Johnson had had with No 10, he added: “The PM is just beginning his recovery and he will be taking advice from his medical team.”</p> \\n<p>On Thursday evening, Downing Street said Johnson, 55, had been moved from intensive care back to the ward “where he will receive close monitoring during the early phase of his recovery”. He was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/05/timeline-boris-johnson-and-coronavirus\">taken into hospital on Sunday</a> after his coronavirus symptoms, including a cough and high temperature, persisted and he was moved to intensive care on Monday evening.</p> \\n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"da6e7b30-c83b-43bf-8d5e-772e3e686b5a\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \\n  <div>\\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/suTKhpuZPww?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\\n  </div>\\n </gu-atom> \\n</figure> \\n<p>The foreign secretary, Dominic Raab, who has been deputising for the prime minister, earlier said Johnson was making “positive steps forward”.</p> \\n<p>Johnson’s pregnant fiancee, Carrie Symonds – who has also had a bout <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/apr/04/carrie-symonds-recovering-from-coronavirus\">of suspected Covid-19</a> – responded to the news by posting a rainbow on Twitter and a series of clapping emojis to show support for the NHS.</p> \\n<p>On Friday morning Johnson’s 79-year-old father also issued thanks. “Relief is the right word,” he told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme, adding: “I feel tremendously grateful obviously on behalf of the family, Boris’s family, my family, family members all over the place, and also, of course, amazingly thankful as well.

He must rest up. As I understand it ... he has moved from the ICU into a recovery unit but I don’t think you can say this is out of the woods now,” he said.</p> \\n<p>“He has to take time. I cannot believe you can walk away from this and get straight back to Downing Street and pick up the reins without a period of readjustment.”</p> \\n<p>He also explained his son’s illness had highlighted the seriousness of the coronavirus pandemic.</p> \\n<p>“I do think about this whole event of Boris going into intensive care, and now ... coming out, it has actually served an amazing purpose,” he said. “In a sense it’s got the whole country to realise this is a serious event. If it can hit the prime minister, for heaven’s sake, well it does come close to home.”</p>',\n",

       "   'body': '<p>Helen Simmons, a 28-year-old film producer from London, went into labour with her second child on the evening of 30 March – exactly a week after Boris Johnson announced a nationwide lockdown. “It felt like a 1960s-style birth,” she jokes.</p> <p>She arrived at the Royal Free hospital with her husband, Charles, at 5.30am the following day. “We were hoping for the best,” Simmons says. Instead, Charles was sent home because of new visitor restrictions brought about by the outbreak, and Simmons was sent to a labour ward on her own. She was hungry – she hadn’t brought enough food with her – so Charles dropped some off and stayed with her for a few hours before being ordered to leave again.</p> <p>For the next 10 hours, Simmons was in labour alone and Charles was relegated to a waiting room outside, like a Mad Men-era husband. It was tough. “The hardest bit of labour isn’t the pushing,” Simmons says. “It’s the contractions. And doing that alone … you don’t realise you need your partner so much, emotionally and physically, until you can’t have that person there with you.”</p> <p>After a 30-hour labour, the majority of that time spent alone, their daughter, Isla, was born on 1 April at 4.40am. Charles was allowed in to watch Isla being born before being ushered out. It certainly wasn’t the birth they had hoped for or planned. Yet Simmons feels the experience meant she discovered an inner strength she hadn’t known she had. “It gave me a newfound respect for women through history,” she says.</p> <p>As the coronavirus pandemic continues, pregnant women across the country will be wondering how it will affect them. “It’s an anxious time for pregnant women,” says Maria Booker of the charity Birthrights. “They are concerned about whether their partner can stay with them or what the birth will be like.”</p> <p>At the moment, according to official guidance, no British woman should have to give birth alone. “Visiting is restricted to help stop the spread of coronavirus,” says NHS England, “but our guidance is absolutely clear that a specific exception should be made for birthing partners when a woman is in labour.” The Royal College of Midwives (RCM) guidelines state that partners may not be able to accompany women during their induction and the early stages of labour because of physical distancing guidelines. But it adds: “At the point you go into active labour, you will be moved to your own room and your birth partner will be able to join you.” Provided, of course, they are not showing any signs of illness. No visitors are allowed post-birth.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"2765a9f42c32ea2fce86cee0a835aac70f785180\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2765a9f42c32ea2fce86cee0a835aac70f785180/0_19_1024_614/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Naomi Edmondson after the birth.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Naomi Edmondson after the birth.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Provided by Naomi Edmondson</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>But there is a degree of confusion about how the rules are being enforced by different trusts. Simmons spent most of her labour alone, but others have partners with them throughout. A business owner from London, Naomi Edmondson, 29, gave birth to a baby boy at St Mary’s hospital in Paddington on 31 March. Her husband, Ally, was allowed to stay with her throughout her planned C-section.</p> <p>What may be noticeable to mothers giving birth, however, is that hospitals seem emptier. A recent survey by the RCM found that 20% of midwife roles <a href=\"https://www.rcm.org.uk/media-releases/2020/march/rcm-plea-help-us-deliver-safe-care-for-pregnant-women/\">are currently unfilled</a> because of self-isolation, coronavirus or existing staff shortages. Last week, Lynsay Coventry, 54, died at the Princess Alexandra hospital in Harlow, Essex. She was the first midwife to die of Covid-19, showing the risks healthcare professionals are taking when carrying out their jobs.</p> <p>Emily Botelho, a 30-year-old artist from Manchester, delivered a baby boy safely on 30 March. Her partner, Richard, was allowed to be by her side. But afterwards, she overheard the midwives on her hospital ward discussing the staff shortages. “There was a bit of chatter about one of the maternity wards possibly having to close, as the staff were off sick and self-isolating,” she says.</p> <p>Many trusts are cancelling home and water births because they require more staff. However, Booker says: “We’d ask that trusts think carefully before pulling their home birth services.” She urges them to think creatively about how to work around staff shortages; some trusts are using private ambulances to serve their home birth teams, to take the pressure off NHS ambulance crews.</p> <p>Martha San, a 30-year-old personal assistant from London, found out through Facebook that her planned home birth had been cancelled because of a shortage of ambulances. Her midwife had planned to call her, but the news broke online first. San had postnatal depression after her first pregnancy, and had planned a home birth to minimise the chances of her mental health deteriorating. “The idea was to have the baby in an environment I felt comfortable in,” she says.</p> <p>When it came to it, “the birth was great”, says San. Her husband, Jamie, was by her side and baby River arrived safely on 29 March at Lewisham hospital in south London. “The fact I was not at home didn’t matter.” But doctors wanted to keep River in for tests and so San had to spend two nights in hospital alone because Jamie had been sent home. Her ward was noisy, and she couldn’t sleep. At 2am on the second night, San broke down. “I started shouting at the midwives and crying,” San says. “I said that I wasn’t meant to be there, this hadn’t been the plan, I shouldn’t be left alone with the baby and I wasn’t coping.”</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"83df0cf3ce87d3793000cf3f3bb0662124a60507\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/83df0cf3ce87d3793000cf3f3bb0662124a60507/0_0_1296_778/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Martha San with husband, Jamie, and baby River.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Martha San with husband, Jamie, and baby River.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Provided by Martha San</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>A midwife moved San to an empty ward so she could get some sleep, and looked after River for a few hours. They were discharged the next morning. But having to spend two nights in hospital alone with a newborn baby was distressing. “It just felt really wrong,” San says. “After the birth, I needed someone there and I didn’t have anyone.”</p> <p>Coronavirus also threw Rachael Collier-Thomas’s birth plans out of the window. The 38-year-old mother from Hertfordshire had planned to have a water birth, but it was cancelled. “When they told me I couldn’t have my water birth, I joked that I’d rather give birth to the baby at home than in a labour ward,” Collier-Thomas says. “But I didn’t actually expect that to happen.”</p> <p>When her waters broke on 24 March, the contractions were so mild that she carried on pottering at home. “I thought I could be like that for days.” A few hours later, Collier-Thomas felt an urge to push. “I thought: it can’t be the baby – it’s too early,” she says. “I haven’t even called the hospital.”</p> <p>Collier-Thomas delivered her daughter, Lottie, on her (formerly) white sofa, with the help of a local doula who had raced around. She is adamant that she didn’t seriously plan to have her daughter at home. “I know that home births can be dangerous,” Collier-Thomas says. “But maybe, subconsciously, I thought: ‘I really don’t want to have my baby on the labour ward.’” Collier-Thomas is not alone: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2020/apr/05/expectant-mothers-turn-to-freebirthing-after-home-births-cancelled\">as a result of the coronavirus lockdown</a>, other British women are turning to freebirthing, giving birth without any medical support. Some are concerned about the risk of contracting coronavirus in hospital; others have had their planned home births cancelled, and prefer to go it alone, without even midwives on hand. But having your baby at home, without medical supervision, can lead to a greater risk of complications.</p> <p>All the women I spoke to understand the pressures the NHS is under – and are not bitter that their births didn’t go as planned. “It’s hard to be upset,” says Simmons, when your own birth does not go to plan “because there’s so much going on. I totally get it.” Even though San’s hospital stay was upsetting, she has nothing but praise for the midwives doing their best under such difficult circumstances. “They were doing an incredible job,” she says. “But they can’t play the role of midwife and birth partner to every woman on the ward.”</p> <p>The strangeness of giving birth during a pandemic doesn’t end when you get home, though. Given the lockdown, many families won’t meet newborn arrivals for weeks, if not months. Helena (not her real name), a 25-year-old teacher from Edinburgh, gave birth to her first child at Edinburgh Royal Infirmary on 24 March. “The staff were brilliant,” she says. “Calm and supportive.” But not being able to rely on family or friends for childcare is tough. “We’re first-time parents trying to figure it out, without family for support,” she adds. “It’s stressful and overwhelming.”</p> <p>For some, coronavirus has cast a shadow over a joyful time. “It’s really tainted everything,” says Chloe Goodman, 38, a solicitor from Macclesfield. She gave birth to her daughter, Clara, on 20 March. Goodman describes the care she received at Macclesfield district general hospital as “brilliant”. But she feels upset Clara won’t meet her grandparents for months. “They’re only tiny for such a short period of time,” Goodman says. “They change so quickly.” Helena is also finding things strange. “I should be showing my baby off and going out and seeing people. But, instead, I’m sitting at home, feeling scared.”</p> <p>Many expectant mothers may be contemplating their births with trepidation. And the whisper networks of expecting-mum WhatsApp and Facebook groups can be frightening. “I’d been freaking out before the birth and imagining the worst,” says Edmondson. “But actually being in the hospital was the least worrying part of it all.”</p> <p>Edmondson urges women to ignore the rumour mill, and trust the NHS. “In the hospital, it’s not as bad as everyone says,” she adds. “For me, it was calm, and when you have your baby you’re in this lovely bubble. You’re not paying attention to all the scary stuff people are posting on social media.”</p>',\n",

Show my picture to people as soon as you can.” Then Amabie was gone.</p> <p>The story circulated in newspapers – as did copycat sightings, including one of a land-based, ape-like version in 1876.Later depictions included, notably, Shigeru Mizuki’s ghosts and ghouls-filled manga <em>GeGeGe no Kitaro </em>(1960-69).</p> <p>Though Mizuki passed away in 2015, his <a href=\"https://twitter.com/mizukipro/status/1239818518536704001\">production company tweeted his drawing of Amabie</a> on 17 March, with the words: “May the modern epidemic disappear.”</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"7759a26de2036920bf97b1186c9cb4399f358f65\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7759a26de2036920bf97b1186c9cb4399f358f65/0_161_4032_2418/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A noodle Amabie mascot created from chikuwa (tubular fish ‘sausage’) rising from a bowl of udon noodles.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A noodle Amabie mascot created from <em>chikuwa</em> (tubular fish ‘sausage’) rising from a bowl of <em>udon</em> noodles.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: OKP Design</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Wishful thinking maybe, but that one tweet sparked Twitter hashtags such as #amabiechallenge and #amabieforeveryone. While some users, including manga artists such as Mari Okazaki, have been sharing <a href=\"https://twitter.com/cafemari/status/1241697999731822592\">paintings and drawings of Amabie</a>, other Twitter users have been more creative, posting pictures of embroidery, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/udonnoww/status/1243005039938953217\">bowls of </a><em><a href=\"https://twitter.com/udonnoww/status/1243005039938953217\">udon</a> </em>(thick wheat noodles) and <a href=\"https://friday.kodansha.co.jp/article/103565\">bento</a><em><a href=\"https://friday.kodansha.co.jp/article/103565\"> </a></em><a href=\"https://friday.kodansha.co.jp/article/103565\">lunchboxes</a> all inspired by the apparition. Some have even dressed themselves (and their pets) up like Amabie and tweeted the photos alongside their own hopeful messages. And now Japan’s Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare has enlisted Amabie for <a href=\"https://twitter.com/MHLWitter/status/1248143633225666562\">an awareness flyer it tweeted</a>, urging people to “stop the spread of infection.”</p> <p>The hope — and sometimes humour — that accompanies each depiction is real, and Amabie has become a unifying force that has Japan reaching deep into its own obscure past to find solace in uncertain times.<br></p>',\n",

It’s no time to buy fighter jets</a>, Journal, 8 April). This Covid-19 crisis focuses our minds on where priorities really lie; the NHS will undoubtedly emerge as a frontrunner.</p> <p>We need to spend on “national defence” because that is a prime responsibility of government, but it should be commensurate with our national income and with the real threats facing our nation.</p> <p>In that light, one has to question whether spending between £2bn and £3bn per year (actual government figures are hard to come by) on maintaining a Trident submarine on constant nuclear deterrent patrol at sea – when the missiles are not targeted and have been at “several days’ notice to fire” for over 20 years for lack of any perceived nuclear threat – is now a proper use of our rapidly vanishing national financial resources.</p> <p>This is on top of some £60bn-plus to replace the submarines, their missiles and other assorted costs associated with Trident.<br><strong>Cmdr Robert Forsyth RN (Ret’d)</strong><br><em>Former executive officer of a Polaris submarine and nuclear submarine commanding officer</em><br><strong>Cmdr Robert Green RN (Ret’d)</strong><br><em>Former Fleet Air Arm nuclear-armed aircraft bombardier-navigator</em></p> <p>• George Monbiot deserves a prize for his article – such clear common sense. It makes it even more ludicrous that, despite spending £205bn on a new generation of nuclear weapons, the end product will not even remotely be “independent”. We have to borrow from the US, on a rotating basis, the missiles on which to put our nuclear warheads.</p> <p>A sign of foolish national vanity? Certainly. Theft from the NHS? Inevitably.

href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/jonathanjonesblog/2009/jul/28/antonello-da-messina-renaissance-art\">Antonello</a> was one of the first Italian artists to explore the subtlety of oil paints, which he learned about from Flemish paintings that made their way to the court of Naples. Here he uses that refined skill to paint a very human, vulnerable Christ whose agony on the cross is all the more touching for being realistic, without the gore and horror of medieval art. Antonello anticipates Michelangelo in making us feel an almost sensual compassion for Jesus.

       "   'body': '<p>You would think that, during the Covid-19 crisis, doctors are at a premium and are being snapped up with open arms by the NHS. Unfortunately, that seems not to be the case. I am a UK- and NHS-trained doctor, and for the past six years I have worked as a senior emergency medicine doctor in the NHS. I am also an NHS-qualified GP. Since mid-January I have been working as a civilian doctor for the Ministry of Defence.</p> \\n<p>When I saw the strain that the NHS was under, I felt it was my professional and moral obligation to offer my services. You would think that this would be fairly easy. The General Medical Council has been contacting doctors who have given up their registration in the past three years and they are being granted temporary registration if they wish to volunteer. But there is nothing on the GMC website directing registered doctors on how to volunteer.</p> \\n<p>The British Medical Association, the trade union representing doctors, has been of no help either. When I asked about this subject I was sent a couple of links to generic career advice and advertised jobs pages.</p> \\n<p>Other routes – eg Google searches, posting on LinkedIn and even some direct approaches to hospitals – have all been equally fruitless. I must say that I am at a total loss as to how I go about volunteering to work in the NHS in this time of crisis.

When “clap for carers” began, I was very moved, and of course there is something beautiful about the collective outpouring of gratitude. But the neglect and underfunding of the NHS have been screamingly obvious in every period in which the Conservatives have been in office. The drive to privatise is in the Tory DNA. Sure, they are talking the talk now – how could they not? – and doing the right thing vis-a-vis the NHS, but this is only temporary.</p> \\n<p>So is it wrong to hope that the clapping and saucepan-banging might also be seen as a movement that declares: “We love our NHS. We hate what the Tories, in their ideological savagery, have done to it”? To borrow from a recent demo placard: how can we symbolically and practically “rage, rage against the lying of the right”?<br><strong>Peter Kaan</strong><br><em>Exeter, Devon</em></p> \\n<p>• Unlike John Crace (<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/apr/08/rishi-sunak-ditches-the-staight-talk-for-lessons-from-the-old-school\" title=\"\">Rishi Sunak ditches the straight-talk for lessons from the old school</a>, 8 April), I found Rishi Sunak’s “most terrifying utterance” his throwaway reference to his giveaway billions “having to be paid for”. If the recent history of the financial crash and bank bailout is anything to go by, we all know who will be doing the paying.</p> \\n<p>How many years of austerity can we look forward to this time, to preserve our society’s unequal status quo? How many low-paid workers in essential services, currently being eulogised by ministers for saving the nation, will end up footing the bill? How many individuals and small businesses will go to the wall while the usual tax-avoiding millionaire suspects survive in splendid state-subsidised isolation?

       "   'body': '<p>Towards the end of his landmark work <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2007/dec/08/society1\" title=\"\">A Secular Age</a>, the philosopher Charles Taylor wrote that, while churches in the west have emptied at an accelerating rate in the 21st century, most of us still seemed to value their presence in our cities, towns and villages. Traditional places of worship are still cherished, Prof Taylor suggested, because they act “partly as a holder of ancestral memory, partly as a resource against some future need (eg a rite of passage, especially a funeral); or as a source of comfort and orientation in the face of some collective disaster”.</p> <p>That the coronavirus pandemic counts as a “collective disaster” is beyond dispute. But, at least in a physical sense, our churches, mosques and synagogues have found themselves <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/17/church-of-england-suspends-services-coronavirus\" title=\"\">unable to provide a space of refuge</a>. As with almost all other forms of human bonding, faith has been driven into the cybersphere by the need to socially distance. With the pews empty, this will be an Easter weekend like no other, both for regular churchgoers and for those who, in uniquely challenging times, might have been tempted to pay a visit.</p> <p>The timing of the lockdown has been cruel for the three main Abrahamic religions. Easter is preceded by the Jewish Passover and followed by Ramadan. Collective commemoration, reflection and celebration lie at the very core of these great religious festivals. But for Jews this week, the traditional gathering of extended families for the Seder meal (marking the ancient Hebrews’ liberation from slavery in Egypt) could only take place via Zoom and Skype. As <a href=\"https://forward.com/opinion/441753/the-coronavirus-is-transforming-judaism/\" title=\"\">one American rabbi</a> drily observed: “Judaism is (temporarily) not in the synagogue. Judaism is now in the cloud – which, let the record note, is a biblical euphemism for God.”</p> <p>The rites of passage to which Prof Taylor referred have been diminished to the point of being unrecognisable, stripped of the joys and consolations that come from communal witness. Guest lists for church weddings and baptisms have been torn up. Funerals have become heartbreakingly lonely affairs, with mourners limited, at best, to immediate family members. The ritual washing of the body before Islamic and Jewish burials has been jeopardised and complicated by fear of infection and limited access to personal protective equipment.</p> <p>As churches celebrate the Paschal mysteries behind closed doors, there has been <a href=\"https://www.spectator.co.uk/article/will-coronavirus-cause-a-religious-resurgence-or-its-ruination\" title=\"\">some concern</a> that, in countries such as Britain, coronavirus might finish off the job that decades of western secularisation began. Religious observance is a habit as well as an affirmation of faith; habits, once interrupted, are sometimes hard to resume. Given the work done by people of faith in helping the homeless, running food banks and channeling vital aid overseas, it is to be hoped that such fears are groundless.</p> <p>There is already evidence to suggest that they are. A study has <a href=\"https://www.thetablet.co.uk/news/12707/surge-in-online-google-searches-for-prayer-\" title=\"\">found that</a> as the pandemic spread last month, Google searches for the word “prayer” boomed across 75 countries, dwarfing anything previously seen in data going back to 2004. In Britain, online streaming of services from churches has generated virtual congregations <a href=\"https://www.thetablet.co.uk/news/12717/hundreds-of-thousands-of-catholics-attend-live-stream-mass\" title=\"\">far bigger</a> than the numbers of those previously attending in person. A similar pattern is being observed in Jewish synagogues. Isolation seems to be breeding the opposite of spiritual apathy.</p> <p>Britain’s churches, mosques and synagogues must continue to play their part in helping the country through this ordeal, as they will do this weekend. The idea of sacrifice lies at the heart of the Christian meaning of Easter. On a gloriously sunny bank holiday weekend, staying at home will be a necessary sacrifice for all of us to make. There will be more to come.</p>',\n",

       "   'body': '<p>The volume of food that would otherwise be wasted and is received every week by the UK’s largest food redistribution charity has more than doubled since the coronavirus lockdown.</p> <p>In a better-than-average “good week” FareShare would typically be given 350 tonnes of food via its 24 regional distribution centres, but this has soared to 711 tonnes a week after the government <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/20/london-pubs-cinemas-and-gyms-may-close-in-covid-19-clampdown\">ordered the closure</a> of millions of hospitality businesses around the country, it has revealed.</p> <p>The organisation takes good quality surplus food from across the industry – direct from suppliers as well as from supermarkets – and redistributes it to almost 11,000 frontline charities and community groups. This typically provides 1m meals a week to vulnerable and needy people, along with essentials for regional food banks run by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2019/nov/13/more-people-than-ever-turning-to-food-banks-charity-says\">the Trussell Trust</a> and smaller local projects.</p> <p>Its chief executive, Lindsay Boswell, said the organisation had “ripped up” its business model in order to adjust to the unprecedented disruption to the food and drink supply chain triggered by the outbreak of the coronavirus.</p> <p>“It’s been real plate-spinning,” said Boswell. “In the early phase we suffered from a complete collapse in food donations as shoppers rushed out to panic buy and demand soared. That was very worrying. Then the government’s decision to close food service companies opened the floodgates.</p> <p>“With diminishing numbers of volunteers due to self-isolation we had to channel all our resources into making sure it was collected on time and not wasted.” Without physical distancing restrictions the organisation would probably be tripling its flow of food, he estimates. There has also been a switch in focus from providing food for meals to assembling food parcels.</p> <p>Boswell says virtually all donations have been gratefully received although there had been some “well-motivated offers, including a pantechnicon full of iceberg lettuces” which could not be used due to a massive amount of existing salad crop. Even before the outbreak of the coronavirus, demand for surplus food had soared against a background of growing dependence on <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/food-banks\">food banks</a> and rising <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/homelessness\">homelessness </a>in the UK.</p> <p>But wholesalers have been struggling to deal with tens of thousands of tonnes of fruit and vegetables, fresh meat and dairy products no longer required by restaurants, hotels and schools.</p> <p>As much as £20m of food with a shelf life of less than three months was at one stage lying in warehouses, according to the Federation of Wholesale Distributors, after the government <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/20/london-pubs-cinemas-and-gyms-may-close-in-covid-19-clampdown\">ordered the closure</a> of millions of hospitality businesses around the country.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Callout callout-coronavirus\">  <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div data-callout-tagname=&quot;callout-coronavirus&quot;&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Callout&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;callout-coronavirus&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>Boswell added: “An estimated 35% of the calories we consume are outside the home. So if you think of all those meals, whether school lunches or going out to restaurants in the evening – that’s a lot of food that now has nowhere to go.”</p> <p>In London FareShare has partnered with the capital’s two other major food redistribution charities – City Harvest and the Felix Project – to provide a more targeted emergency response service for Londoners during the coronavirus crisis. The three organisations have formed the London Food Alliance, with each taking the lead in a designated borough to help distribute food to people in local communities.</p> <p>It is now boosting its 1,500-strong army of volunteers, helped by a new partnership with the British Red Cross, and in a single week it received more volunteer applications than for the whole of last year. “We regard many new volunteers as the fifth cavalry – we may not need you now but we will,” said Boswell. A call for experienced forklift operators led to 24 qualified people responding within just two hours.</p> <p>As well as routinely supplying surplus food, FareShare’s major supermarket partners are also providing “top up” food as well as funding to help with logistics. This week the Co-op convenience store chain scrapped its £2.5m Easter advertising campaign and will instead use the airtime to encourage viewers to donate to FareShare.</p>',\n",

       "   'body': '<p>Tommy Chong has got the munchies. It’s early afternoon in locked-down LA, and last night he was on the pot cookies. “My wife, Shelby, just made a whole batch of them – oatmeal and maple syrup.” He stops to correct himself. “I put the pot in there, and of course I put too much in. Last night it got me almost comatose. Shelby got kinda mad at me. You know like when a kid gets so stoned all you do is sit there and grin.” Chong is 82 next month.</p> <p>He sounds about four decades younger – his voice is deep, sexy, pulsing with life. Chong is one half of the most famous <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2014/dec/25/back-with-a-bong-why-we-need-stoner-movies-more-than-ever\">stoner comic partnership in history, Cheech and Chong</a>. In the 1970s, they not only sold out their live shows, they topped the album charts and had huge box-office hits with movies such as Up in Smoke and Cheech and Chong’s Next Movie. The double-act were as radical as they were bonkers. And while the films were ostensibly about two aspiring rock stars in search of the next spliff, they introduced audiences to a downtown, multiracial Los Angeles rarely seen in movies.</p> <p>Their characters, Pedro de Pacas (Richard “Cheech” Marin ) and Anthony “Man” Stoner (Chong), were hopeless wasters, but heroically so. In their frequent spats with the police, they invariably won – even if they didn’t have a clue how or indeed even notice that they had.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"46fee27a6c2b501f9f4a0e5bf4a78dfcbbf543c5\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/46fee27a6c2b501f9f4a0e5bf4a78dfcbbf543c5/0_0_3600_2457/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Tommy Chong, left, and Cheech Marin in Cheech and Chong in Concert, 1973.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"683\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Feel the vibe ...

After they split up he enjoyed success as a solo comic and businessman (though that ended up in a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2003/sep/20/film.usa\">jail sentence</a>). Before Cheech and Chong, he was a guitarist with Bobby Taylor and the Vancouvers, co-writing their hit single <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WsFuZ4Lap4Q\">Does Your Mama Know About Me</a> – a gorgeous song about a mixed-race relationship. Although they only had the one hit, the band were influential – something Chong is again quick to point out. A young Jimi Hendrix played with them, and they were partly responsible for the Jackson Five (who opened for them in 1968) signing to Motown. Or rather Chong was.</p> <p>“I was the lawyer who signed the contract for them,” he says. Hold on, I say, you’re not a lawyer. Chong laughs. “Well, I was the whitest guy they knew. I looked like a Jewish guy, a lawyer. So literally Bobby Taylor took the contract and gave it to me and said what d’you think?” Chong gave it the OK and the rest is history.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"48b7aec2e1f97ba99e4ce675ea58a2a2090d570d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/48b7aec2e1f97ba99e4ce675ea58a2a2090d570d/0_0_3504_2123/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Roll up, roll up ...

Chong and Marin in the 1978 comedy Up in Smoke.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Allstar/Paramount</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Chong segues from one celebrity anecdote to another, all of them connected by one degree of separation – himself. And now we have landed at British royalty. “I played <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WsFuZ4Lap4Q\">Does Your Mama Know</a> for Prince Harry. We were in the Spencers’ house. We went there for a wedding two years ago.” Did he get high with Harry? “He was busy with the wedding,” Chong says, discreetly. “He took a liking to Shelby because she had read all about him and knew his life story.”</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--inline\"> <blockquote> <p>England is probably the most racist country in the world with its royalty and its caste system</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>He may have a lot of time for Harry and Meghan, but not for the royal family as a whole. “England itself is probably the most racist country in the world with its royalty and its caste system.” Chong does not like to hold back. “You still have the system that colonised the world. Meghan wasn’t white enough. She would never be white enough. I can see why they left. Megan could never be accepted into the royal family. She knew that and the whole family did. The whole English system is set up that way.”</p> <p>From the royals he turns to Donald Trump. He doesn’t know Trump personally, but he says he remembers coming across his type as a young man in British Columbia. “I knew people like Trump all my life in Canada – we called them gangsters. And they hung around the Stock Exchange in Vancouver. That’s where his grandpa made all his money. Running whores, and gambling joints and bootlegging.”</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"8ef6988271b6f9bc48bf0362fd729e7ffa36c68b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8ef6988271b6f9bc48bf0362fd729e7ffa36c68b/0_0_3182_2400/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Bobby Taylor and The Vancouvers ...clockwise from top, Bobby Taylor, Wes Henderson and Tommy Chong in about 1968.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"754\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Bobby Taylor and The Vancouvers ...clockwise from top, Bobby Taylor, Wes Henderson and Tommy Chong in about 1968.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Michael Ochs Archives/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Chong is convinced that once he leaves office, Trump will face criminal charges. “He is a Russian asset. History will show that. He’s been colluding with Russia from the get-go – the Mueller report even said it. The only reason they couldn’t do anything is because he’s the president, and the minute Trump’s not president they’re gonna put his ass in jail.”</p> <p>It’s a big claim. Do you really think Trump will end up jailed? “Yes. If Harvey Weinstein and Bill Cosby are an example, yes, I think he will. So he’s going to go. He’s insulted too many people.” When you go after judges, he says, it comes back to bite you in the ass.</p> <p>One of the things he finds most offensive about Trump is his attitude to people of colour. “Just because you were born with money don’t make you any better than anybody else on the planet, but he’s still sticking to that thing that because he’s white and privileged he somehow is better than other people.”</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--inline\"> <blockquote> <p>I knew people like Trump all my life in Canada –\\xa0we called them gangsters</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Race, and racism, has been at the heart of Chong’s life and his humour. He grew up in Calgary, a conservative Canadian city, the son of a Chinese father and a Canadian mother with Celtic roots. He still sounds shocked by the attitudes he experienced there as a child. “You know, they would sell brazil nuts in the grocery store and they’d call them nigger toes. And they had little <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/wordofmouth/2010/may/25/consider-liquorice\">black liquorice beans</a> called nigger babies. ‘Can I have five cents worth of nigger babies?’ Again he laughs – this time appalled. “That’s where I grew up.”<br><br>As a young boy he remembers his whole class apart from him being invited to a birthday party. “I just looked out of the window of the second storey and could see my friends gathering around the fire. I was uninvited ’cos the girl’s father was worried she might end up with a coloured guy or Chinese guy.”</p> <p>By then, he was already used to being isolated. When he was a baby, his mother contracted TB and he developed pleurisy. “My first memories are hospital and my mom was quarantined in a sanitarium. I never saw her for the first three or four years of my life. So I feel I’ve been through this pandemic before with my mother.”</p> <p>How is he coping? He says he is missing his five children and the grandchildren. “It affects everybody’s life. We can’t do our family reunions. It’s lonely. Even though you’ve got your kids a phone call away, you still want to hold them and hug them and be part of their life.” But, he stresses, he’s lucky – he’s got Shelby’s company, her gourmet cooking and the pot cookies.<br><br>It was in the late 60s that he teamed up with Richard Marin, a Mexican-American whose nickname was Cheech. They played music and did comedy sketches in a Vancouver strip club. The funny stuff soon took over, and the strip club became a comedy club.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"df09c878567d4aac311df06c4640a275404cac55\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/df09c878567d4aac311df06c4640a275404cac55/711_304_4993_2995/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Marin and Chong pose, in 2018, to commemorate the 40th anniversary of Up in Smoke.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Marin and Chong pose, in 2018, to commemorate the 40th anniversary of Up in Smoke.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Ron Eshel/Invision/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Cheech and Chong prided themselves on taking things to extremes – spliffs the size of tubas (famously smoking labarador poo in their first film, Up in Smoke), idiocy off the IQ ratings and staggeringly incorrect sexual politics (in Cheech and Chong’s Next Movie, Cheech only desists from having sex with a woman who seems to have died on him because she wakes up).</p> <p>He says his favourite Cheech and Chong sketch is Hey, Margaret – about a husband describing a porn film to his wife. First, an elderly woman has sex with the pizza delivery man, then she has sex with a dog, and the husband reports it all back to Margaret with relish. Finally, she has sex with a “god-damned coloured guy” and the husband turns away sickened. It was bad-taste comedy with bigotry as the butt of the joke.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7GwxVGUJRzE\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/7GwxVGUJRzE?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>Why does he think they were so popular? Simple, he says. “We communicated with people. They would get high to come and see us and then we’d act crazy and make them laugh.”</p> <p>Could they really be such dedicated stoners and still be so prolific, or was it an act? Chong sounds slightly offended by the question. “Oh no, for the most part we were always high. We always smoked a little before we went out there. That was part of the job.”</p> <p>Drugs, he says, were essential to the creative process. “It was my job as a writer and performer to deliver the goods. So if that meant being stoned, I gladly did it. I found that the more stoned I was, the more crazy the movie was, and the more successful we were.” What was his drug of choice when writing? Oh, he says, there were a few. “A little bit of cocaine and the acid and then the weed.”</p> <p>Cheech and Chong appeared to be having the time of their lives. But by the mid-80s they had fallen out. “We had some pretty heated arguments. Cheech would go on vacation and I’d be left alone to write the movies. Then he’d come back and I’d direct them, and he got tired of it. He was thinking I got too much credit.” Did he have a point? “ Well, I maintain that if he’d listened to me it would have been better all the way around.”</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--inline\"> <blockquote> <p>The only way people listen to you is if you’re the director. If you’re not the director, people don’t give a shit what you’ve got to say</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>In his memoir, Marin called Chong “the world’s humblest megalomaniac”. Talking to Chong today, I get a sense of what he means. Alongside the hippy-dippy mellowness, there is a man who clearly likes doing things his way. “The only way people listen to you is if you’re the director. If you’re not the director, people don’t give a shit what you’ve got to say.” So it was a power struggle between him and Marin? “Well, yeah, for sure. Because what Cheech wanted was the part where you got the power.”</p> <p>Chong calls Marin a genius – not just for his comedic skills, but for his photographic memory and the sharpness of his brain. As for himself, he says his great gift has always been for teaming up with the right person – whether it be Marin or Shelby, his second wife, to whom he has been married for 45 years.</p> <p>At times, he sounds calculated when he talks about what Marin brought to the table. “We clicked from the off. And I soon realised I’ve got a goldmine with this guy because LA is made up mostly of Mexicans. So I realised, oh man, we can own this place with comedy. And we do. I mean our comedy’s lasted longer than anything.”</p> <p>In the end, he says, it was money that did for them. “I always say we broke up ’cos we got rich. My joke is you can’t make a rich Mexican do shit! Hehehe! That still makes me laugh.” Did wealth change them? “Yea. You make the wrong decision. You’d rather do your summer house than go on the road again.” Chong says if you’re in the entertainment business and you’re not 100% dedicated to entertaining, you might as well give up. And they did.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"b6c90bbf10dd9839c67e6d30b096be0053177bfc\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b6c90bbf10dd9839c67e6d30b096be0053177bfc/0_0_3000_1646/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Tommy and Shelby Chong and Cheech Marin perform at the Cheech &amp; Chong show in New Jersey in 2018.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"549\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Tommy and Shelby Chong and Cheech Marin perform at the Cheech &amp; Chong show in New Jersey in 2018.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Bobby Bank/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>After the split, Chong developed his solo standup. But he hated being away from Shelby. “I couldn’t leave my wife at home. She’s too beautiful to leave alone.” (He tells me three times how beautiful she is and how much he loves her.) So Shelby learned how to do standup and went on the road with him. Occasionally, in his live act he would phone Cheech, but Cheech refused to play along. “He wouldn’t be funny, so I quit phoning him.” And they fell out some more.</p> <p>In 2003, at the age of 65, Chong was jailed for nine months for selling glass pipes on the internet that could be used for smoking cannabis (though they were produced as collectible works of art): each bong had his name and a picture of his face on it.

His hair and beard turned white, and he emerged from incarceration looking rather professorial. Since then he has seen off two cancers, and returned to the road.</p> <p>Despite the rise of rightwing populists, impending environmental catastrophe and the Covid-19 pandemic, he says life has never been better.“I see today as the best time to be alive because we weren’t content with what we had. We were always looking for that better club, the better audience to play in front of.”</p> <p>In his 80s, he has never been more occupied – gigging with Shelby, launching his own brand of marijuana (<a href=\"https://tommychong.com/\">Chong’s Choice</a>) in 2016 when the drug was legalised for recreational use in California, and spending time with his kids. He even made up with Cheech, thanks to Paris. A decade ago his son found an email from Marin on Chong’s computer asking if he wanted to try to put aside differences – Paris didn’t bother to tell his dad, wrote yes and hit reply.</p> <p>Since then Cheech and Chong have been gigging again, with Shelby as their opening act. On the day we speak, he is supposed to be promoting a Cheech and Chong video game, but he is too excited about new opportunities to mention it. Doe he think the duo might make another film? Silence. But I can sense his boyish excitement at the other end of the line. “Well I can’t really tell you that now,” he says coyly. So there might be one? “I’ve got to wait till it’s a reality as opposed to telling you dreams. I’ll turn it into a reality and then I’ll tell you.”</p> <p>And with that he’s off to satisfy those munchies and realise his dreams.</p> <p>• <a href=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.LDRLY.cheechandchong&amp;fbclid=IwAR2xj-ydYBefXm3qRn6tpBvJ0JYhS2qnk4lZ8I0GbJXiTdjvngUo8NVkAA8\">The Cheech &amp; Chong Bud Farm video game</a> is <a href=\"https://apps.apple.com/us/app/cheech-and-chong-bud-farm/id1498492128?fbclid=IwAR3fwQskLbdqsiRSmoMLw40rlhyXd0zv5Fb4lAAEddpoFq6Aj-Z36pH93F4\">available for download on 20 April</a></p>',\n",

The anecdotes flow freely as Braff describes the moment they became JD and Turk and their bromance began immediately. “Every time I was playing the wide-eyed guy walking around, I was just being me because I couldn’t believe it was happening,” says Braff. They mirror their characters a lot as they talk about their hatred of the show’s credits, X-ray blunders and more. <em>Hannah Verdier</em></p> <p><strong><a href=\"https://podcasts.apple.com/tr/podcast/unlocking-us-with-bren%C3%A9-brown/id1494350511\">Unlocking Us</a> </strong><br>Oprah-endorsed self-help queen, academic and bestselling author Brené Brown hosts this podcast, essentially an anxiety-quelling Ted talk in audio form. If that sounds worthy, perhaps it’s exactly the boost we need right now; not least in the first episode, where Brown throws out a Mandela quote and implores us to temper our expectations with new experiences (or FFTs, “effing first times”), especially in the current pandemic (“I’m a grown-ass person, but I don’t know what the hell I’m doing … ”). <em>Hannah J Davies</em></p> <h2>Producer pick: <a href=\"https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/heres-the-deal/id1505238447\">Here’s the Deal</a></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"29a13c59b8ffd14a4bd57fdcfd8e3af7380e9ffd\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/29a13c59b8ffd14a4bd57fdcfd8e3af7380e9ffd/0_400_6000_3600/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Talking politics ...

In a week that saw Biden’s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/apr/08/bernie-sanders-ends-2020-presidential-race\">only rival for the democratic nominee suspend his campaign</a>, he sat down (virtually of course) with the Michigan Governor <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/aug/02/michigan-governor-race-progressive-candidates\">Gretchen Whitmer</a>. She is the reason to listen to this week’s episode. Whitmer has simultaneously garnered admiration from the more powerful Democrat players, and drawn ire from a certain Republican in the White House for how she’s dealing with Covid-19 in her state.</p> <p>She talks about having to work, and enjoy working, with Republicans across the aisle to build a consensus – breath of fresh air for anyone who, like me, who feels bipartisanship has been all but lost in the US. There’s a small monologue by Biden in the middle about how great Americans have been through the coronavirus crisis, but you can skip that and come back in for the listener’s questions at the end.</p> <p>Unfortunately for Joe, I don’t think he’s found his calling in podcasting.

I remember playing with Agassi after Andre had 18 months out, for very different reasons, but he came back fresh and invigorated to play. He kept going until he was 36.</p> <p>“In those days that was old for a top tennis player. I stopped when I was 33 and that was pretty old at the time. But with training techniques and injury prevention, players are certainly playing longer. So you would like to think that if Andy’s body permits and he still has the motivation that I think he does there can still definitely be a few Wimbledons left in him yet.”</p> <p>Henman said he had spoken to Roger Federer, who had planned to make his comeback at Wimbledon after knee surgery, and reckoned the eight-times champion, at 38, would be similarly frustrated, with dwindling opportunities left to add to his 20 majors. “Someone like Federer, coming to the end of his career, is devastated but understands the decision. It will affect a lot of people in a lot of different ways.”</p> <p>Henman is particularly concerned the disruption will hit low-ranked players hardest. “Further down the pecking order this will have huge implications where people are not going to have an income.”</p> <p>He also added his voice to those of the outgoing All England Club chief executive, Richard Lewis, and the relatively new ATP chairman, Andrea Gaudenzi, who fear there is a possibility the 2020 calendar may be wiped out entirely. “You have got to be positive and optimistic that [the US Open in August] can be played but, if it weren’t, I don’t think anyone would be greatly surprised,” Henman said.</p> <p>The game’s next big event may be the second ATP Cup, where Henman made a confident debut as the Great Britain coach at the start of the year, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/jan/09/australia-edge-great-britain-in-atp-cup-quarter-final-thriller\" title=\"\">leading them to the quarter-finals</a>. “If I were asked to do it again, schedule permitting, I would definitely do it because it was a lot of fun,” he said.</p> <p>“If you had said a month ago the next event was going to be the ATP Cup in Australia in January, I think people would have looked at you a bit strangely.

Alice Cole (not her real name) is in her final year at the University of Brighton and wanted to go into the NGO sector as a researcher.

According to the Institute of Student Employers (ISE), many firms have scaled down their recruitment of entry-level staff and more than a quarter of businesses are reducing the number of graduates they hire this year.</p> <p>While some firms are moving assessments and interviews online, the majority have cancelled them. “Thousands of young people are supposed to be entering the labour market from July and they could be left without work and nothing to do while coronavirus is sorted out,” says Stephen Isherwood, chief executive of the ISE. “We need to make sure that a whole generation isn’t lost.”</p> <p>One graduate recruiter says they have already retracted offers. “Firms are being realistic and most are putting recruitment on hold. No one wants to offer an opportunity which might not be there in three months’ time.”</p> <p>Routes into graduate jobs have also been affected. Short-term work such as internships and placements will be reduced by almost a third, say the ISE, and 68% of firms have cancelled work experience and taster opportunities. As a result, <a href=\"https://trendence.co.uk/downloads/coronavirus-pandemic-gen-z-study\">almost 40% of students</a> are now worried they won’t be able to get a job at all.</p> <p>James Turner, CEO of the Sutton Trust, says although we don’t know the full extent of the virus on the graduate job market yet, shrinking opportunities tend to be bad for social mobility, with students unable to access internships and other work experience placements. He says: “Internships are increasingly necessary for many graduate jobs, and there is a risk that young people with professional connections may be able to find work experience while other, openly-advertised, opportunities cease to exist.”</p> <p>Nick Hillman, director of the Higher Education Policy Institute, says although most companies will feel the impact, there will be some big winners and some losers depending on the sector. “Even in this crisis, some employers are booming. Technology companies, the food sector and logistics firms are busier than ever,” he says. “You might not end up with the job you hoped for but you can get a job.”</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/law/2020/apr/03/how-will-law-exams-be-affected-by-coronavirus\">How will law exams be affected by coronavirus?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Students can also rely on their university careers’ services, and Kim Connor Streich, marketing director of the Debut Careers app, thinks it is vital that applicants practice video interviews and presenting on camera.</p> <p>Others, however, think we will see more students deciding to take master’s degrees or further courses of study. In other times of recession, staying on at university has been a good alternative to struggling to get a job, with the hope that individuals will emerge not only with improved skills but into a recovering jobs market. Cole thinks this is her only option. “I live in a rural area of Wales so there are very few job opportunities around here. I’m currently looking into doing a master’s,” she says. “The easiest thing to do right now is to delay entering the job market by a year so things have a chance to get back to normal.”</p> <p>James Catchpole, director of the legal practice course at the City Law School, thinks the end result may be a more highly skilled workforce. “We need to make sure we prepare them even better than we have done and turn them into even better candidates,” he says.</p> <p>Hillman agrees. “You can get government-backed loans for postgraduate study, and unis will be falling over themselves to recruit home students as international numbers will be down significantly.”</p>',\n",

So to redress the balance a little, I would like to tell you about Pete, who died of Covid-19 last weekend, the first person I have known to have died of the disease. Just so that he and thousands of others like him don’t get forgotten.</p> <p>Pete wasn’t a close friend: more of a friend of a friend and someone my wife would join on long weekend walks. But he was a lovely man. He was at Exeter University several years before me – he took his studies so seriously, it took him four years to complete a three-year degree – but photos from that time show him as a dead ringer for Steely Dan’s Jeff “Skunk” Baxter. He was also known for driving his motorbike far too fast and for crashing cars. On leaving Exeter, he went on to establish his own communications business in Brighton and was heavily involved in several charities working in India and Africa. He is survived by his wife, Heidi, and his two children. My heart goes out to them. It’s still not clear what the rules are for funerals in the time of the coronavirus but it will undoubtedly be a scaled back affair. Sometime, when this horror is all over, we will have a party to remember him properly. And for all the many others whose deaths were merely reported as a grim number at the daily Downing Street press conference.</p> <h2><strong>Tuesday</strong></h2> <p>I found myself totally unsettled by the news that Boris Johnson had been moved to the intensive care unit at St Thomas’ hospital. So much so, that I had to switch off Twitter and stop watching the news: even though it is literally my job to watch the news. Part of the shock was that less than three hours earlier, Dominic Raab had insisted at the Downing Street press conference that Boris had only gone to hospital <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/apr/05/boris-johnson-admitted-to-hospital-with-coronavirus\">as a precaution</a> and was basically still in charge of the country. So the only possible conclusion was that Raab had lied about the gravity of Boris’s condition or that, even as de facto deputy prime minister, he had not been kept in the loop. Neither of which inspired much confidence in the government. If we couldn’t trust the government to tell the truth about something so critical as the prime minister’s health, why should we trust it to tell the truth about anything else? The No 10 communications team really needs to start upping its game: we’re long past the point where serious news can be withheld for a few hours. But mostly my shock at the deterioration of Boris’s condition was on a more existential level. You can dislike his politics and think little of of his suitability as prime minister, but he is still the country’s leader. At a very basic, psychoanalytical level Boris is the country’s daddy. And no one ever wants to lose their dad, no matter how crap a dad he has been. We want our parents to be strong. Invincible, even. The last thing we want is proof that the coronavirus really is totally indiscriminate.</p> <h2>Wednesday</h2> <p>Finding ways of filling up the days – other than with work – is proving to be more and more of a challenge. I have had two more goes at Hilary Mantel’s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2020/mar/01/the-mirror-and-the-light-hilary-mantel-review-thomas-cromwell\">The Mirror and the Light</a> but still haven’t got the concentration to get past the first four pages. That makes it six attempts at the book so far, but it’s testament to the power of the writing that I have been gripped on each occasion. By this time next week, I am determined to make it to at least page six. My wife is rather more inventive than me and had found on Twitter the #GettyMuseumChallenge, which encouraged everyone to recreate works of art using objects they had lying around the house. After a great deal of passive resistance from me – “Why on earth would I want to do that?” – Jill persuaded me to join her as Piero della Francesca’s Duke and Duchess of Urbino.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"c57c461dcc0875e37df49931242a491d9ef76b48\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c57c461dcc0875e37df49931242a491d9ef76b48/0_693_5200_3120/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Portraits of Duke and Duchess of Urbino, by Piero della Francesca, circa 1475, in the Uffizi Gallery, Florence.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Portraits of Duke and Duchess of Urbino, by Piero della Francesca, circa 1475, in the Uffizi Gallery, Florence.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Peter Barritt/Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Her costume was constructed using some lace bought from a French market some years ago, along with a pair of headphones covered with tin foil and a paper flower. Mine was made from some red felt, left over from making one of the children’s Christmas stockings, rounded off with a heavy Le Creuset saucepan for the head gear. It certainly had the necessary gravitas. Once the pictures were taken against the kitchen wall, our son Photoshopped them into the appropriate frame and we posted the diptych on Twitter and got a wonderful response from many people. Apart from the bloke who suggested I should have gone the whole hog and broken my nose like the original duke. Now our fame is to be extended further. Yesterday I got an email from a producer working on a TV film Grayson Perry is making about creativity in lockdown, requesting permission to use our photo. A Bafta surely must be in the offing.</p> <h2>Thursday</h2> <p>I have spent most of the football season wishing Spurs could play rather more like Liverpool and less like a bunch of bored, non-league players. And much to my surprise, I have found that I have missed the final two months of the season far less than I expected. It turns out that there are limits to my masochism and were the Premier League to announce that the final placings for this year’s season were as of the beginning of March, I’d be quite happy. If we can’t make the Champions League we can at least avoid the Europa League. Best of all, though, would be for the entire season to be considered null and void so that Spurs would automatically qualify for the Champions league on last season’s performances. </p> <p>But now I find myself not just wishing Spurs would play like Liverpool but behave like them too. Earlier this week, Liverpool announced it had made an error in laying off and furloughing many of its non-playing staff and were going to retain them all. Just a week after announcing profits in excess of £70m, the Tottenham board – despite much pressure from the supporters’ trust and other interested parties – came to an entirely different decision and is laying off and furloughing non-playing staff. At White Hart Lane, the directors seem to care more about the bottom line than basic human decency. To make things even worse, the club has broken physical-distancing guidelines by holding training sessions in the park. I’ve sometimes been ashamed of Spurs’ on-field performances; now I am ashamed of their off-field ones. It’s not too late to reverse the decision. The club may be surprised at just how many fans won’t forget or forgive if they don’t.</p> <h2><strong>Friday</strong></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"4774071928b826df4ec0dfda95606ed2e2f4ccd7\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4774071928b826df4ec0dfda95606ed2e2f4ccd7/0_70_3500_2101/1000.jpg\" alt=\"An image on a hoarding in London of the Queen broadcasting her message\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Queen: Next, they’ll be having me sing Vera Lynn</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Dominic Lipinski/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>There’s no getting away from it. As for many people, it’s been another tricky week on the mental health front. I miss my children more and more – I dare say I might be feeling differently about this if they were both still teenagers and going stir crazy indoors – and our frequent phone calls are bitter-sweet reminders of the distance between us. It’s the not knowing when I will next get to see them that hurts the most, and I am planning on observing government guidelines to the letter. But I did promise to try to include some good news each week, so here goes. </p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/apr/10/boris-johnson-father-stanley-tells-relief-pm-leaves-intensive-care\">Boris Johnson is out of intensive care</a>: I feel far more emotional about that than I expected. I’ve also spent the last three and a half weeks growing a beard, something I’ve never done in the past. So that’s a first. I’m not sure it’s a total success though and I doubt it will be staying much longer. My sisters have been polite about it but my friend Alex said I look like a serial rapist on death row. I’ve also now almost finished cataloguing my books, which has been mind-numbingly dull and unexpectedly time consuming as my spreadsheet skills are minimal. Next I plan to move on to cataloguing our ceramics. Soon I will be down to cataloguing the exact amount of dog and cat food we have left. But the undoubted highlight of the week has been the arrival of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/apr/08/wisden-2020-offers-plenty-scope-cricket-loving-self-isolators-ben-stokes\">this year’s Wisden Almanack</a>. I haven’t had time to more than dip in so far – Mark Lawson’s moving essay on how cricket helped his mental health was my first port of call – but the new Wisden is always a sure sign of the start of summer. Though what kind of summer it will be is still in the lap of the coronavirus. And who knows what next year’s Wisden will look like?</p> <p><strong>Digested week, digested:</strong> Same again.</p>',\n",

       "   'body': '<p>Labour must be a party of responsibility that backs frontline police officers and promises to keep the public safe from crime, the new shadow home secretary, Nick Thomas-Symonds, says.</p> \\n<p>In an interview with the Guardian, the Welsh MP, promoted to the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/apr/05/three-key-appointments-keir-starmer-fills-top-shadow-cabinet-roles\">shadow cabinet</a> in Keir Starmer’s comprehensive reshuffle last weekend, said crime was a “progressive issue”, and lavished praise on the police for enforcing the coronavirus lockdown.</p> \\n<p>“Labour have a message that we will keep you, your family and your community safe. That’s very much the approach that I come from,” he said.</p> \\n<p>“I grew up in the constituency I represent, in the eastern valley of the South Wales coalfields, in an era when jobs and opportunities were being taken away by the Thatcher government. And it really did strike me then, that crime was an issue that progressives had to be serious about.”</p> \\n<p>“Responsibility is the word that I would use,” he said. “Responsibility to others, to society: there is such a thing as society, there’s no doubt about that. Crimes have victims; they damage the fabric of that society. But there is a responsibility for government as well, and it’s the responsibility to keep people safe.”</p> \\n<p>He was at pains to praise the police officers given the task of enforcing the coronavirus lockdown, despite widely cited instances of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/mar/30/uk-police-guidelines-coronavirus-lockdown-enforcement-powers-following-criticism-lord-sumption\">over-zealousness</a>.</p> \\n<p>“I’ve obviously seen those various incidents that have happened. But I just think it’s unfair when I as a politician have handed over this enormous set of powers, to then start picking on particular officers and particular forces.</p> \\n<p>“What I’m trying to do is to recognise the difficult situation, and the latitude we do need to give to our officers,” he said. “By and large, I think the police are getting it right.”</p> \\n<p>With some of the best-known figures in Jeremy Corbyn’s shadow cabinet relegated to the backbenches, either voluntarily or at Starmer’s hand, Thomas-Symonds and his new shadow cabinet colleagues will be intently scrutinised for clues to Labour’s direction.</p> \\n<p>Like the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/apr/02/is-keir-starmer-failing-call-out-government-coronavirus\">party’s new leader</a>, he strikes a resolutely constructive tone regarding the government’s handling of the virus.</p> \\n<p>“In a public health emergency, a national crisis like this – it’s difficult to think of anything comparable since 1945, frankly – my view is that we have to support the government in the aim of minimising loss of life through the crisis. That’s absolutely in the national interest, and absolutely what we aim to do. But we have to balance it with scrutiny,” he said.</p> \\n<p>But Thomas-Symonds said he hoped the crucial frontline role played by NHS workers and others in the crisis, and the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/video/2020/apr/10/thousands-across-uk-applaud-nhs-workers-on-third-week-of-clapforcarers-video\">weekly nationwide round of applause</a>, would help to change attitudes to migration.</p> \\n<p>The government’s new points-based system, due to come into force next year, is expected to set a salary threshold of £25,600 – or more in some sectors – with the aim of halting low-skilled migration.</p> \\n<p>“One thing I really hope this crisis has taught the Conservatives, is that the value of what people do is not always reflected in the salary that they’re paid,” Thomas-Symonds said.</p> \\n<p>“We hear a lot of warm words about our police, the ambulance services, the fire services, our NHS workers, our care workers. But take nurses: when you look at the salary threshold that’s being proposed, nurses, especially when they’re starting off, are below it, and I think the government has to seriously look at how we value people in our society.”</p> \\n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"69935b48-c2b3-4b2c-8945-fa8b7bcba6a9\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \\n  <div>\\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/BS0PhRAx2W8?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\\n  </div>\\n </gu-atom> \\n</figure> \\n<p>He declined to be drawn on what migration system Labour would like to see, saying it would be “fairer”, and that developing it in detail would be an important focus for the party over the next two to three years.</p> \\n<p>“In terms of migration and broad principles, Labour’s an internationalist party. Labour will always believe in the right to live and to work in other countries. Of course we will; also in terms of fairness, and a recognition that the immigration system is about people. It’s not about numbers, it’s not about statistics, it’s about people,” he said, describing the Windrush scandal as a “shameful” episode.</p> \\n<p>While little known outside Westminster, the 39-year-old has written two biographies of Labour’s great figures – Aneurin Bevan and Clement Attlee – and practised as a barrister until becoming an MP in 2015.</p> \\n<p>Before training as a lawyer, he taught politics at Oxford University. “I’ve studied the history of the home secretaries, and my impression is that the really successful home secretaries are strategic,” he said. “They have a really strong sense of what their priorities are, and they give a very strong sense of direction, and when that disappears, I think that’s when you start to get into trouble.”</p> \\n<p>He is surprised his Tory opposite number, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/apr/08/priti-patel-accused-of-avoiding-mps-scrutiny-during-national-crisis\">Priti Patel</a>, has not played a more prominent role during the crisis. Major decisions are being overseen by a “quad” of senior ministers, chaired in the prime minister’s absence by the first secretary, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/apr/06/dominic-raab-set-to-lead-uk-through-covid-19-hurdles\">Dominic Raab</a>, and including the health secretary, Matt Hancock, the chancellor, Rishi Sunak, and the cabinet office minister, Michael Gove.</p> \\n<p>Asked about Patel’s absence from the inner circle, Thomas-Symonds says: “I do think the home secretary should be out on the media regularly, showing her support for our police officers. We want to say them very clearly as politicians, we back what you’re doing and we understand the difficulties.”</p> \\n<p><br></p>',\n",

Since then the Premier League announced it too would advance monies, a total of £125m in solidarity and “parachute” payments that would otherwise have been paid next season.</p> <p>In a letter to clubs this week, however, the EFL chairman, Rick Parry, said he would not be transferring that money to clubs now “while additional clarity is sought on other financial matters, particularly in respect to player wages”.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/apr/10/world-cup-winner-leeds-norman-hunter-coronavirus\">World Cup winner Norman Hunter in hospital with coronavirus</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Elsewhere in his letter Parry laid out plans to finish the Football League season in a sharp burst, playing 341 fixtures over 56 days from June.

       "   'body': '<p>Oscar-winning Spanish film director Pedro Almodóvar has written “a settling of scores” in a long diary entry written during the coronavirus lockdown, which accuses Madonna of treating him and actor Antonio Banderas as “simpletons”, and not asking permission to use footage of them in a documentary.</p> <p>In the post <a href=\"https://www.indiewire.com/2020/04/pedro-almodovar-quarantine-essay-madonna-1202223894/\">published in translation on IndieWire</a>, Almodóvar recalls first meeting Madonna on the set of the film Dick Tracy, and then later in Madrid during her 1990 Blond Ambition world tour. “Aside from myself, she was only interested in meeting one other guest, Antonio Banderas,” he said of the latter meeting, with Banderas having recently acted in Almodóvar’s film Tie Me Up! Tie Me Down!. “Hollywood (and Madonna) had fallen in love with him.”</p> <p>Madonna had the flamenco party Almodóvar had arranged for her filmed for the documentary Madonna: Truth or Dare (also known as In Bed With Madonna). “She didn’t ask for permission to use our images, and she even dubbed me, because my English mustn’t have been that good,” Almodóvar complains. “I don’t mind if this seems like a settling of scores – if it had been the other way round (me filming Madonna and her team and making a film with all that material which I would then premiere around the world), I would have taken such a hit in the form of a lawsuit; I’d still be recovering from it. Madonna treated us like simpletons and I had to say it one day.”</p> <p>He said Madonna decided on the seating plan and placed Banderas’s then-wife Ana Leza far away from him, with herself by his side. “Antonio’s harassment was one of the main storylines and she, obviously, edited in how she dispatched Ana Leza with only one sentence. At the end of the dinner, Ana dared to get close to our table and told the divine blonde sarcastically, ‘I see you like my husband, it doesn’t surprise me, all women like him, but I don’t mind because I am very modern.’ To which Madonna replied: ‘Get lost.’ All this may seem frivolous, and it is.”</p> <p>He also says Madonna also asked Banderas, who didn’t speak English then, a provocative question via Almodóvar. “Ask him, she told me again, if he likes women to hit him … Antonio made the same gesture, which meant neither/nor, but that he was at the service of ladies’ desires.”</p> <p>Madonna has not responded to his post. The Guardian has contacted her UK representatives for comment.</p>',\n",

If that is the case, England internationals could be unavailable for their clubs for weeks on end, given the 2020 Six Nations tournament also needs to be completed, raising questions over player welfare and player release. The scenario could mean England playing anywhere up to seven matches in October and November.</p> <p>Any proposal to restructure the season would have to be put to the Premiership via the Professional Game Board but a senior source said that in the autumn “there will be a massive compression of club and international fixtures and it’s not all going to fit”.</p> <p>World Rugby sees the international game as the priority because of the revenues it can drive, and is expected to confirm contingency plans for its summer tours this month as unions anticipate crippling losses. The RFU is forecasting losses of £50m in the next 18 months but can make around £10m per home match with Twickenham fixtures accounting for 85% of the union’s revenue.</p> <p>Sweeney told the BBC: “We might go [to Japan] in October. That’s one option, because obviously they’d rather host, they make more money when they host, and we’d come back and play our autumns [internationals].</p> <p>“If we weren’t able to travel to each other we’d want to do something to fill our gap, so we’re looking at a range of different contingencies. An obvious one is: do you stage a Six Nations in the autumn but link it into the Six Nations the next year, and you have a home and away series?”</p> <p>The Japan tour was to be a developmental opportunity for fringe players with England’s World Cup squad rested but Jones has recently suggested that is no longer the case in light of the enforced break. He will have guaranteed access to England players for the rearranged Six Nations match against Italy but it may need to be negotiated for rescheduled summer tours.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"2afc9aa3f1de9836f21b7203f9b6fac301ca86b0\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2afc9aa3f1de9836f21b7203f9b6fac301ca86b0/0_48_3339_2003/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The Covid-19 outbreak has forced coach Eddie Jones into a rethink for England’s Japan tour.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Covid-19 outbreak has forced coach Eddie Jones into a rethink for England’s Japan tour.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Andy Buchanan/AFP via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>“The situation is hypothetical,” said an RFU spokesperson. “As you would expect the RFU is talking to all parties to consider every possibility in the best interests of players and fans. The impact of Covid-19 requires cooperation and compromise and there may be opportunities for both club and country from rescheduling the calendar.”</p> <p>Sweeney also confirmed discussions over a reduction in England’s £25,000 match fees – <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/apr/01/rfu-cut-england-25000-match-fees-covid-19-rugby-union\">as revealed by the Guardian</a> – and suggested he wants the team to follow the lead of Wales, who have agreed pay cuts of 25%. Sweeney added: “[The players] are a very reasonable bunch of people. The executive team and Eddie himself have taken cuts which are in excess of 25%.”</p>',\n",

To celebrate, they’ll have “a very tame blowout” and recreate a typical Christmas day: Bucks Fizz and croissants in the morning, films and chocolate in the afternoon, then a huge roast dinner.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"820b00de602fcb72834285d4d02d9c2ddb7a4f2f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/820b00de602fcb72834285d4d02d9c2ddb7a4f2f/0_0_3024_3203/944.jpg\" alt=\"Sarah Parmenter and her four-year-old son created this Easter tree to remind the Easter bunny to stop at their house.\" width=\"944\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Sarah Parmenter and her four-year-old son created this Easter tree to remind the Easter bunny to stop at their house</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: SarahParmenter</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>“We want to make it as fun as possible,” says Jones. “It feels like we’re all living in the week between Christmas and New Year anyway, so we want to create a festive day, celebrating each other, in this time of lockdown.”</p> <p>Rik Sterken and his family had planned to spend a few nights on the Welsh coast this weekend. Instead, they’re taking a mini-camping trip into their back garden. “We reckon the tent just about fits,” says Sterken. “We’re trying to keep a sense of normality but also a sense of adventure as well.”</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Callout callout-coronavirus\">  <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div data-callout-tagname=&quot;callout-coronavirus&quot;&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Callout&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;callout-coronavirus&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>On Friday night, Sterken, his wife and two children will eat pizzas from their home-built, wood-fired pizza oven for the first time this year, and enjoy barbecued bacon butties on Saturday morning. “The kids are really excited, although we haven’t told them yet they’ll be sleeping on camping mats,” he says.</p> <p>And unable to go to France on holiday, Crista Hazell and her husband Jon will be donning rabbit ears and painting on whiskers to be the Easter bunny for their older neighbours.</p> <p>“We know they can’t see their families so thought we’d help them find a smile on Sunday by placing a few Easter eggs (with clean hands) on doorsteps before the sun rises,” says Crista, an author and education consultant from Bristol. “It’s something a bit daft, but hopefully we can give them a little love and enjoyment.”</p>',\n",

       "   'body': '<p>It’s hard to write music during lockdown. A lot of songwriters I’ve spoken to just aren’t getting inspired at the moment. I did try. I wrote a song called Wash Your Hands and thought: “I’d better put the guitar down now.” That’s why I decided to start hosting listening parties on Twitter instead, which I’ve been doing every night from 9pm with the hashtag <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/timstwitterlisteningparties?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Ehashtag\">#timstwitterlisteningparties</a>. We pick an album and listen together at a set time – 9pm or 10pm – with commentary from one of the artists involved.</p> <p>The first week I did it we had Blur, Ride, Franz Ferdinand and Oasis – <a href=\"https://twitter.com/BoneheadsPage?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor\">Bonehead</a> did the commentary for that one. As soon as we started, it had become a thing. One of the maddest things was seeing it as the top trend on Twitter.</p> <p>Everyone who’s taken part so far has said it’s like doing a gig. There’s the trepidation beforehand, then an hour of craziness, and finally a period where you’re kind of decompressing. The only difference with this is that nobody’s nicking your beers!</p> <p>We’ve done about 30 so far, including our debut album <a href=\"https://www.discogs.com/The-Charlatans-Some-Friendly/master/12876\">Some Friendly</a>, and there have been some great moments. My personal highlight is me not realising that I’d played Reading festival in 1999 – I still can’t remember it now, even though people have been telling me exactly what happened.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2016/may/28/tim-burgess-my-life-before-was-sky-high-these-days-its-real-and-natural\">Tim Burgess: ‘My life before was sky high. These days it’s real’</a> </p> </aside>  <p>I also loved Dave Rowntree revealing his collection of laminated artefacts from the Parklife era – old photos, gig tickets. He made so much effort and that really upped everything because the listening party became a visual thing. The Cribs did one for Men’s Needs, Women’s Needs, Whatever and were showing their old tour diaries and lyric sheets. Those are the kind of insights you don’t often get in a magazine – bands probably wouldn’t want to show those at the time of release anyway, but now there’s a bit of history involved and they feel more relaxed.</p> <p>What I like is that it’s giving people the opportunity to listen to an album in its entirety again. Musicians I talk to, even the younger artists, all want to make an album that’s a masterpiece, that has a theme running through it, a start and a finish. That has been crushed in a way because people felt they didn’t have enough time on their hands. But now all we have is time, so it’s a beautiful thing for this moment.</p> <p>We’ve had listeners from all over: New Zealand, Japan and even Antarctica. Part of the reason we do them at 10pm is because that’s when Japan is waking up. The other reason is because that’s when the 10 o’clock news is on, and I wanted people to have an alternative to that – you can watch the news at any time these days; this is a way of offering up an alternative good time instead.</p> <p>It’s not the only thing I’m doing at the moment. I’ve got a new solo album, I Love the New Sky, coming out in May. I spoke to the label about whether we should postpone it, but we agreed it was a good time to put music out, to have something to look forward to. I’ve also been doing some home schooling with my six-year-old. But I’m not a teacher and I don’t think I should try to be. Instead we just go for a walk every day and talk about volcanoes, tornadoes, the coronavirus and the environment. That’s not a bad start, is it? He’s also got into wrestling, so we do a bit of that.</p> <p>But most of my time is spent on these listening parties. I’m always working on them. All day I’m getting direct messages and emails and I’m normally up until midnight answering questions. The listening party itself keeps you on your toes. I usually have a few tweets lined up beforehand – that way I can answer everyone’s questions while it’s live. It’s hard to keep up. There’s so many people out there saying things like “where are we now?” and I have to be on hand to say “two minutes and 34 seconds into track four ... no, it’s two minutes and 36 seconds now!”</p> <p>It’s growing every day. We could keep this going until Christmas. Sleaford Mods have just said they want to do all of their albums, every Thursday at 8pm. That’s what I love about it, it’s all about impulsive decisions and it spirals into a thing of its own.</p> <p>When I was first starting out, I would listen to <a href=\"https://www.longlivevinyl.net/classic-album-neil-young-harvest/\">Harvest by Neil Young </a>to learn how to write songs. That was more of a conscious thing, but I’m sure listening to all these classic albums will affect my <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2016/may/28/tim-burgess-my-life-before-was-sky-high-these-days-its-real-and-natural\">songwriting</a> in some subliminal way. Hopefully it will, and you won’t ever get to hear that song I wrote about washing your hands.</p> <ul> <li><p>Tim Burgess’s I Love the New Sky is out on 22 May via Bella Union</p></li> <li><p>As told to Tim Jonze</p></li> </ul>',\n",

Fortunately, if you’re missing the competitive zeal of live sports, multiplayer games such as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/games/2019/sep/25/fifa-20-review-not-your-typical-annual-update\">Fifa 20</a> enable fans to create their own tournaments – providing both distraction therapy, and the chance to beat your sister to the Premier League title. Here are five recommended multiplayer sports sims, and how to set them up for fierce, sofa-based competition.</p> <h2><a href=\"https://www.ea.com/en-gb/games/fifa/fifa-20\">Fifa 20</a> (PS4, Xbox One; £29.99)</h2> <p>One of Fifa’s great strengths is its options for offline tournament play. There are 63 competitions included, such as the English FA Cup and German DFB-Pokal. If you live with 19 other people you can even set up an entire Premier League season, with every club human-controlled.</p> <p>Best of all is the Custom Tournament mode, where you and three (or seven!) additional family members can go head to head, using your choice of Fifa 20’s 700 teams. Flexible options include two-legged ties and the number of permitted substitutes, plus your choice of trophy and stadium for the final.</p> <p>There’s sadly no way to set up an online tournament alongside friends, although <a href=\"https://www.fifplay.com/fifa-20-co-op-seasons/\">Co-op Seasons</a> is a fine alternative. Here you team with a mate against similar tandems, with a system of 10 divisions ensuring you’re matched to opponents of equal ability. All results count towards a global leaderboard.</p> <h2><a href=\"https://www.playstation.com/en-us/games/mlb-the-show-20-ps4/\">MLB The Show 20</a> (PS4; £44.99)</h2> <p>The best choice for a living room baseball tournament that won’t threaten your double glazing is The Show’s excellent Home Run Derby mode. It’s available for two, four or eight players, with the simple aim of scoring more homers than your opponent to progress.</p> <p>The Show features fully licensed players from all 30 MLB clubs, and you can set tournament brackets to feature any of these. There are various time limits, but three minutes feels optimal, particularly when factoring in a cool additional feature: hit two home runs longer than 440 feet and you score a 30-second bonus.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"0e201485e476abc638ff84e565ce1140fc1f4008\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0e201485e476abc638ff84e565ce1140fc1f4008/0_0_3600_2160/1000.jpg\" alt=\"MLB The Show 20\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Best living-room baseball ...

In real life, anyway: AO2 enables you to play out the tournament and declare your own victor. While The Championships aren’t officially licensed, the game’s “London” stadium and the “Large Gold 4” and “Medium Silver 17” trophies are clearly inspired by the biggest event on the tennis calendar. <br> It’s slightly more complex than the other games listed here as custom tournaments require at least eight players, but there’s an easy way to offset this: simply start your competition, then simulate the entire quarter-finals round. You’re now set for four-way action featuring your pick of Rafael Nadal, Gaël Monfils, Ash Barty, Johanna Konta and more.</p> <p>If you have a few younger players in your household, Mario Tennis Aces (Nintendo Switch) is a lot of fun and allows four-player matches, and it’s portable so you can take it out into the garden.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"9045f3f7e47f09b7ca1705736ac7881708c50adc\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9045f3f7e47f09b7ca1705736ac7881708c50adc/501_79_3339_2003/1000.jpg\" alt=\"AO Tennis 2\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Play out your favourite tournament ...

That’s purely down to its offline excellence. While PGA’s lack of online options disappointed, sofa-based play is of a pass-the-pad nature that immaculately apes the series’ Mega Drive roots.</p> <p>Up to four players compete over 12 courses, the pick of which is Paracel Storm: a preposterous yet brilliant 18-hole round based on Battlefield 4. Stick-swinging controls suit players of all ages, but Sega alumni can make use of a classic three-tap technique if so preferred.</p> <p>If you have trouble getting a copy, serious players might want to try <a href=\"https://thegolfclubgame.com/\">The Golf Club 2019</a>, which aims to be a very accurate simulation of the sport. More accessible alternatives include the long-running cartoon-style favourite <a href=\"https://www.playstation.com/en-gb/games/everybodys-golf-ps4/\">Everybody’s Golf </a>(PS4) or the incredibly hectic <a href=\"https://partygolfgame.com/\">Party Golf</a> (PC, PS4, Xbox One, Nintendo Switch), currently just £2 on Switch.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a0ed54c62703a96129399f4e47517b2bd8228457\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a0ed54c62703a96129399f4e47517b2bd8228457/66_0_1800_1080/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Rory McIlroy PGA Tour Golf\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Cult following ...

In addition to setting up offline tournaments, you can create online competitions too. Up to 35 friends can join you in playing out a real NBA season with six expansion teams, or a created one that mixes classic rosters with contemporary ones.</p> <p>If you’d rather stick to home-bound b-ball, the offline Playoffs mode is the way to go: a straight knockout tournament where up to 16 players can be user-controlled. Again, set-up options are plentiful, including a fantasy draft option in case you’re desperate to make Giannis Antetokounmpo a Brooklyn Net.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"0f3bfdbbb5487d09db577550d69f9c9f1172a20c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0f3bfdbbb5487d09db577550d69f9c9f1172a20c/55_0_902_541/500.jpg\" alt=\"NBA 2K20\" width=\"500\" height=\"300\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Home-bound b-ball ...

       "   'body': '<p>Much has been made of the Football Association’s 50-year ban from 1921 on female players using its affiliated pitches, which scythed down the women’s game just as its growth had accelerated, with matches attracting attendances in excess of 50,000. Little, though, has been said of the eventual lifting of the ban in 1971, or of the man who authored the letter rescinding it. Now, the University of Nottingham is set to induct posthumously Sir Denis Follows – the then secretary of the FA and an alumnus – into its Sport Hall of Fame.</p> <p>The uncovering of the small but critical role of Follows, who died in 1983 aged 75, in the development of women’s football – which later led to him being named honorary life vice-president of the Women’s Football Association – happened by chance. Follows’s daughter, Maggie Ferris – another Nottingham alumnus – mentioned her father in a routine fundraising phone call with the university.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"12e3dea5f5f46db546c8869e07537ea9cf234a93\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/12e3dea5f5f46db546c8869e07537ea9cf234a93/112_0_1141_1426/800.jpg\" alt=\"Sir Denis Follows’ daughter, Margaret Ferris.\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Sir Denis Follows’ daughter, Margaret Ferris.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: No credit</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The student that jotted down a few notes from their call took them away and soon afterwards the university and Ferris began to explore the history of a man who had a firm belief in equality and a person’s right to play sport and felt the lifting of the ban was natural. “He was always campaigning about things,” explains Ferris. “That was just part of what he was. And he was quite self-effacing, he never made a big deal of any achievement. Well, he was pretty pleased about winning the World Cup,” she adds with a chuckle.</p> <p>Follows was FA secretary in 1966. He introduced the idea of the first mascot for a finals – World Cup Willie – and separated the tournament’s organising committee, for which his daughter worked in the holidays, from the everyday running of the FA. He also presided over the loss of the Jules Rimet trophy, when it was stolen from a stamp exhibition, and subsequent recovery.</p> <p>“Dad brought it home [after it had been recovered] and he actually slept with it under the bed until we won it,” recalls Ferris. “And then it went to a special place to be displayed. When it was due to be taken to Mexico for the 1970 World Cup there was a real issue of how they were going to get it there.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"a3e1d19b70e1feb53b15b462724e1a28b99f0b78\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a3e1d19b70e1feb53b15b462724e1a28b99f0b78/0_0_1931_2506/771.jpg\" alt=\"Sir Denis Follows outside the FA headquarters with World Cup Willie, the 1966 World Cup mascot.\" width=\"771\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Sir Denis Follows outside the FA headquarters with World Cup Willie, the 1966 World Cup mascot.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: No credit</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>“The Jules Rimet cup was fabulous, it was absolutely beautiful. I’ve got a photo of my mum in our back garden holding it with our dog. Anyway, he decided that the best way to get it to Mexico was in his briefcase, so he just carried his briefcase all the time. In that way he was quite practical. It worked. First it was under the bed, then in his briefcase.”</p> <p>When Nobby Stiles’ contact lenses went missing, it was Ferris’s sister who went to an all-night Boots to get some more and Follows, who had connections with pilots as general secretary of the British Airline Pilots’ Association (Balpa), who arranged for them to be flown out to Stiles.</p> <p>Follows’ journey either side of 1966 is equally remarkable. Born in 1908, he started in student politics, becoming chairman of the University Athletics Union, representing the body on the FA council and being given the job of unpaid FA treasurer before becoming president of the National Union of Students.</p> <p>In those various posts he travelled in the 1930s to Latvia before it was invaded by the Soviet Union and to Madrid as Spain slid towards civil war in 1936, attending student conferences. “In a lot of domestic ways he was not capable at all,” says Ferris. “He could just about do tea and toast or boil an egg but in some ways he was a real innovator. He was in his treatment of women. I found an old photograph of a 1930s committee that he was on at the university and a third of the people in the photograph are women. He had always worked with women in an equivalent role, he never expected women to be the underdogs.”</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2020/mar/28/coe-and-ovetts-olympic-debt-to-bureaucrat-who-defied-thatcher\">Coe and Ovett\\'s Olympic debt to bureaucrat who defied Thatcher | Andy Bull</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Follows was partially blind in one eye and was therefore ruled out of national service during the second world war but still joined the RAF as a lecturer. After the war that enabled him to become general secretary of Balpa. Meanwhile he succeeded Sir Stanley Rous as secretary of the FA in 1962.</p> <p>His dual career paths gave him a unique role in the Munich air disaster in 1958. “When there was the the crash with the Busby Babes in it Dad was the general secretary of Balpa, but he was also treasurer of the FA,” explains Ferris. Follows became the union representative of the pilot, Captain James Thain, who was initially blamed for the crash, and spent more than a decade working on the case to clear his name. “Initially he was a scapegoat, guilty [of failing] to clear the ice on the wings despite witnesses saying there was no ice, but Dad got him cleared in 1968,” says Ferris.</p> <p>Three years later Follows drafted the letter that would lift the ban on women’s football. “I knew about it being reversed,” says Ferris, “but I didn’t know about the ban [coming into force] in the 20s. I just knew that there wasn’t any women’s football and accepted that as the status quo.”</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"283e74b223bf00c2b3167e4a11de7ff81687c29e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/283e74b223bf00c2b3167e4a11de7ff81687c29e/84_877_4490_3887/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Players from Southampton Women line up in 1971, one year after the club was founded.

It was traumatic. But he seemed pretty calm at the time, he just dealt with the complaints and just quietly said that, in his opinion, it was an individual decision and that the opportunity should be there for the athletes to participate. It was Lord Carrington [the foreign secretary] and Michael Heseltine [head of the Department for the Environment, which included sport] that were ringing him and putting the heavy screws on but he just stuck by his guns.</p> <p>“Of course it was Seb Coe’s gold medal that year,” she adds. “And he has said himself, I believe, that if it hadn’t been for my father he probably would have never won a gold medal.” Instead, with government funding cut, Follows travelled the length and breadth of the country “trying to raise money for the Olympics, because he was just so desperate for them to be able to do what they wanted to do, without government money at all. And he did it.”</p> <p>His hall of fame induction is on hold due to the coronavirus crisis, but Nottingham’s head of sport, Dan Tilley, is looking forward to recognising his “affinity for student sport, the connection to the university, the fact that he has achieved a huge amount in his career”.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"The Fiver: sign up and get our daily football email.\">  <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/4163\" height=\"52\" data-form-title=\"Sign up for The Fiver\" data-form-description=\"Get our daily email on the world of football\" data-form-campaign-code=\"Fiver_signup_page\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\"></iframe> <figcaption>The Fiver: sign up and get our daily football email. </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Tilley says: “It feels only right that we celebrate him. We push a strong equality and diversity agenda here and it’s nice for our women footballers to reflect on the fact that someone who came through our university lifted the ridiculous ban on women’s football that had been in place since the 1920s. Sometimes sports administrators get overlooked, and actually some of the things they do are quite significant.”</p>',\n",

       "'Key developments in the global coronavirus outbreak on Friday include: Global death toll passes 98,000 At least 98,401 people have died, according to researchers at Johns Hopkins University, who have also counted at least 1.6m infections worldwide. The institution says more than 365,000 people have recovered. UK’s death rate worsens The country recorded 980 deaths in a day, the worst such toll since the outbreak began, taking the cumulative total of those who have died in hospitals to 8,958. The health secretary, Matt Hancock, says about 19,000 tests are being carried out each day and more than 19,000 people are now in hospital with symptoms. Boris Johnson’s condition improves The UK prime minister has been “able to do short walks, between periods of rest, as part of the care he is receiving to aid his recovery”, Downing Street says. Johnson was moved out of an intensive care unit on Thursday. UK health workers to get protective equipment Hancock says the government is issuing guidance on who needs personal protective equipment and who does not, adding that it will only be used when there is a clinical need. He promises that equipment will be distributed to hospitals daily from next week and production and imports will be increased for the future. Ministers have come under increasing pressure over their continued failure to provide all health workers with the means to protect themselves. South Korea: 91 ‘recovered’ patients test positive again In what could be a further blow to hopes of ending the pandemic, officials in South Korea report 91 patients thought to have been cleared of the virus have tested positive again. The prospect of people being reinfected is of international concern, as many countries hope infected populations will develop immunity. Spain lift\\u200bs some restrictions Some non-essential workers will return to work from Monday and face masks will be handed out at metro and train stations under government plans to ease some of the restrictions on public life. Factory and construction workers are to start back next week despite warnings the relaxation of the lockdown could drive a rise in contagion. Spain recorded 605 deaths from Thursday to Friday, down from 683 during the previous 24 hours, in a sign that the lockdown strategy is working. Ireland extends its restrictions Ireland must endure at least three more weeks of restrictions, the taoiseach, Leo Varadkar, says, as secondary school exams are cancelled.

       "'A summary of the biggest developments in the global coronavirus outbreak Key developments in the global coronavirus outbreak on Friday include: At least 98,401 people have died, according to researchers at Johns Hopkins University, who have also counted at least 1.6m infections worldwide. The institution says more than 365,000 people have recovered. The country recorded 980 deaths in a day, the worst such toll since the outbreak began, taking the cumulative total of those who have died in hospitals to 8,958. The health secretary, Matt Hancock, says about 19,000 tests are being carried out each day and more than 19,000 people are now in hospital with symptoms. The UK prime minister has been “able to do short walks, between periods of rest, as part of the care he is receiving to aid his recovery”, Downing Street says. Johnson was moved out of an intensive care unit on Thursday. Hancock says the government is issuing guidance on who needs personal protective equipment and who does not, adding that it will only be used when there is a clinical need. He promises that equipment will be distributed to hospitals daily from next week and production and imports will be increased for the future. Ministers have come under increasing pressure over their continued failure to provide all health workers with the means to protect themselves. In what could be a further blow to hopes of ending the pandemic, officials in South Korea report 91 patients thought to have been cleared of the virus have tested positive again. The prospect of people being reinfected is of international concern, as many countries hope infected populations will develop immunity. Some non-essential workers will return to work from Monday and face masks will be handed out at metro and train stations under government plans to ease some of the restrictions on public life. Factory and construction workers are to start back next week despite warnings the relaxation of the lockdown could drive a rise in contagion. Spain recorded 605 deaths from Thursday to Friday, down from 683 during the previous 24 hours, in a sign that the lockdown strategy is working. Ireland must endure at least three more weeks of restrictions, the taoiseach, Leo Varadkar, says, as secondary school exams are cancelled. The original measures were going to expire on Sunday. “Many of us would like to know when things will go back to normal. The truth is nobody knows for certain when that will be. All we can do for now is take one day at a time,” he says. The Brazilian president, Jair Bolsonaro, a vociferous critic of social isolation who has dismissed coronavirus as “a little flu”, was booed and jeered by people in the capital, Brasília, after going to a bakery. “Go home!” people shout from nearby apartment buildings, and “Bolsonaro out!” Others could be heard banging pots and pans in videos widely shared online, echoing the protests many make from home at 8.30pm every night.'"

       " \"The Grand Départ of the Tour de France Femmes avec Zwift will be in Rotterdam in 2024, Wielerflits reported, citing multiple unnamed sources. The news should be made official this week by the Amaury Sport Organisation (ASO) in the lead-up to the start of the Tour de France in Bilbao. After starting with a circuit race in Paris for its first edition in 2022 and then a road stage in Clermont-Ferrand in 2023, the third edition of the race will head outside of France for the first time in its history. Wielerflits reports that the first three days of the stage race will take place outside of France, starting with a time trial in Rotterdam on August 12, one day after the end of the Paris Olympic Games. Tour de France Femmes 2023Annemiek van Vleuten seals Tour de France Femmes victoryYou’ve come a long way, baby - Vital statistics show sea change in women’s cycling Stage 2 will be a road stage from Rotterdam to The Hague. Starting in Valkenburg, the third stage may bring the riders to the Walloon region of Belgium. The peloton should ultimately reach France on the fourth day of racing. Two of the WorldTour Spring Classics taking place in Belgium, Liège-Bastogne-Liège Femmes and La Flèche Wallone Femmes, are also organized by ASO. Last year, the Tour de France Femmes was an eight-day race that began on the Champs-Élysées in Paris in conjunction with the final stage 21 of the men's Tour de France and ended on La Super Planche des Belles Filles where Movistar’s Annemiek van Vleuten of the Netherlands was crowned the overall champion. The Tour de France Femmes 2023, from July 23-30, will be held across eight stages once again and will take on a whole new area of France this year, starting in the Massif Central. The 956km route will take the peloton south and into the Pyrénées, ending with a mountaintop finish on the iconic Col du Tourmalet on stage 7, the crowning moment of the 2023 Tour de France Femmes, and a stage 8 individual time trial in Pau.
